 AUSTIN, Tex. — Surprises abounded at this year’s South by Southwest film festival, with movies featuring depraved demons, devilish doppelgängers and sadistic senseis all doing despicable things. And yet, one of the most gasp-worthy moments was hearing the tween actor Jacob Tremblay use the F-word in the first five minutes of “Good Boys.” It wouldn’t be the only time in this comedy about a wild day in the life of a few sixth-graders, and it was one of several breakout titles worth knowing about as the film portion of the festival comes to a close on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “If I’m being honest, I am shocked and appalled,” Tremblay joked during the post-screening Q.&amp; A., and added referring to his director Gene Stupnitsky, “Gene told me this was going to be a PG-rated family movie. He lied.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The movie was right at home at a festival that has turned into something of a testing ground for the hit potential of Hollywood comedies. The audience applauded the comic timing of Tremblay and his co-stars, Brady Noon and the scene-stealing Keith L. Williams, and that positive reaction along with a recently released
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF1F9dIbNqM" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  red-band trailer
 </a>
 featuring one of the movie’s producers, Seth Rogen, has fueled social-media interest. “Good Boys” opens nationwide in August.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Another talker was Olivia Wilde’s directing debut, “Booksmart.” Much like “Good Boys,” it follows students on a wild day, but this one is female-focused. Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever star as high school seniors who, on the last day of school, realize they may have studied too hard and partied too softly. They make up for that in one outrageous evening that includes drugged strawberries and a raucous graduation bash. The packed house at the Paramount theater especially appreciated the killer soundtrack and a high laugh-per-minute ratio.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Also winning over festivalgoers was “Long Shot,” a rom-com starring Rogen
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/movies/charlize-theron-long-shot-sxsw.html?module=inline" title="">
  and Charlize Theron
 </a>
 . The crowd was drawn to the combination of smart and slapstick humor, and was also roused by a Boyz II Men cameo. Then, after the screening, could it really happen? Or do dreams just fade away? The pop group did a little East Coast swing in a surprise performance.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The laughs had a mellower edge at the premiere of the Harmony Korine comedy “The Beach Bum,” starring Matthew McConaughey as Moondog, the pothead writer he may have been born to play. The crowd basked in the movie’s hazy glow, and McConaughey was a great sport, attending the after-party dressed in character. Critical reaction to the film was a little more mixed.
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://variety.com/2019/film/reviews/the-beach-bum-review-matthew-mcconaughey-1203158560/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Variety wrote,
 </a>
 “The question here isn’t if McConaughey is having fun, but whether audiences will find his laid-back, ever-lit persona nearly as entertaining to watch.” And
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/beach-bum-review-1193429" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  The Hollywood Reporter said
 </a>
 that the film was “high on style, if not substance.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Humor was also a thread through some of the festival’s darker films, including
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/09/movies/jordan-peele-us-premiere.html?module=inline" title="">
  Jordan Peele’s “Us,”
 </a>
 which opened SXSW and featured a measured number of laugh- and shriek-worthy sequences. Similarly, audiences winced and laughed during “The Art of Self-Defense,” starring Jesse Eisenberg in a deadpan role as an accountant who is brutally attacked by masked assailants. Taking classes at a dojo, he meets a sensei (Alessandro Nivola) with a tainted worldview. The comedy is pitch-black, but the crowd appreciated its sinister quirks.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Other funny journeys down twisted roads included “Porno,” a 1992-set film about conservative Christian teenagers working in a small-town movie theater. After discovering an old film hidden in the walls, they inadvertently unleash a sex demon that wreaks havoc. Keola Racela’s debut feature, with more than one instance of genital mutilation played for laughs, made festivalgoers squirm but got them talking as well.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Villains,” directed by Dan Berk and Robert Olsen, put a fun twist on the home-invasion genre, with Bill Skarsgard and Maika Monroe as criminals on the lam. When their car runs out of gas, they pick the wrong home to break into, that of a couple (Jeffrey Donovan and Kyra Sedgwick) with a few skeletons in their closet and another secret in their basement. And in keeping with the Boys/Boyz festival motif, there was “Boyz in the Wood,” a hallucinogenic comedy-survival tale from the music video director Ninian Doff about teenagers in the Scottish Highlands who become more hunted than hunters. The site Film School Rejects
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://filmschoolrejects.com/boyz-in-the-wood-review/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  described it as “‘Hot Fuzz’ meets ‘Attack the Block.’”
 </a>
 The movie was the subject of so much chatter that SXSW added an extra screening.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The festival wasn’t entirely lighthearted. Its two major jury awards went to much more serious-minded films. “Alice,” Josephine Mackerras’s drama about a woman (Emilie Piponnier) who becomes a prostitute to support her child, won the narrative feature prize. And “For Sama,” which focuses on a young female Syrian filmmaker, Waad al-Kateab, who cataloged harrowing aspects of her life in Aleppo for five years, took the documentary feature award.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But the festival’s biggest and funniest standouts show its programming strengths, and reinforce the value of the theatrical experience, the opportunity to laugh, and sometimes cringe, with a large, responsive audience.

 The new image from Messier 87 was possible, in a large part, because of a network of radio antennas known as the Event Horizon Telescope. That name has a logical tie to its target: The event horizon is “the edge of a black hole, the point of no return,” according to the Times reporter

Nero (Eric Bana), the Romulan villain of the film, uses the principles of the black hole for dastardly ends, creating an artificial black hole out of “red matter” to destroy the planet Vulcan. But then a real black hole creates a time warp that sends Mr. Spock back in time to help Captain Kirk and his own younger self try to stop Nero. (It all makes sense in the movie.)

She left her quiet hometown at 18 to become a cadet, and now she has returned for a new job. Her aunts are overjoyed to have her back — mostly because they want in on the action. While Matilda tries but fails to keep them out of her investigations, she uses her sleuthing skills to uncover the truth about her mother.

 Soon after I first met Agnès Varda, I drove her to the Hollywood police station. It was 2009 and we were supposed to be at a dinner for the Los Angeles opening of her documentary “The Beaches of Agnès,” a lyrical ramble through her life. At that point, Varda had been making movies for more than a half century, a milestone that then seemed to me as impossible as her death last month at 90 seems to me now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Varda showed up late for the dinner, hurrying into the restaurant in a state of agitation. While at a Starbucks, her bag had been stolen — wallet, passport,
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  tout
 </em>
 . Her greatest concern was the digital video camera that had the images she’d shot earlier that day of her friend Sharon Stone. Dazed that Stone and Varda occupied the same corner of the universe, I got it together and took her to the police station, where she filled out a report and murmured doubts about the young desk officer.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 We returned to the restaurant for our dinner, the first of many encounters that we had over the next decade, sometimes for a leisurely meal or at a festival where invariably she was being honored. The last time I saw her was in May at her house on the Left Bank in Paris, an area that became part of her identity. Varda was routinely called the mother or grandmother or godmother of the French New Wave, and often grouped with its Left Bank flank, alongside her friends Chris Marker and Alain Resnais. She wasn’t always comfortable with the maternal moniker though she later embraced it — and why not? She had shown the way.

</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 A longtime feminist, she was acutely sensitive to oppression and many of her movies center on women. In a 1975 interview with a French magazine, she said she didn’t have any more problems than her male cohort; making movies is difficult for everyone. At the same time, she was aware of her standing as the lone female director in the New Wave and how her presence could be used — as she put it — as an “
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  alibi
 </em>
 assuaging the consciences of the men.” But there were also rules. “As long as I was ‘little Varda,’ ‘little Agnès,’ the exception,” and she didn’t get in anyone’s way, she said, she was “helped out, supported and appreciated by my colleagues and companions.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Varda was in her mid-20s when she shot “La Pointe Courte” in 1954 and a photographer for the Theatre National Populaire in Paris. It was some years before she made her second feature, “Cléo From 5 to 7” (1962). In between those two movies, she made short films, had her first child (a daughter), met her husband,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.criterion.com/boxsets/1055-the-essential-jacques-demy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  the director Jacques Demy
 </a>
 (a son followed much later), and traveled to China. “Cléo” was a great success, and she continued to make excitingly adventurous, insistently political work. Among the most unsettling is “Le Bonheur” (1965), a shocking, pitiless evisceration of the romantic vision of heterosexual marriage in which women are fundamentally disposable and replaceable.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Le Bonheur” was criticized, including by those who wanted Varda to wag her finger at patriarchy and female oppression, doing the audience’s work for it. But hers is not a cinema of the obvious. One sustaining pleasure of her films is that they don’t neatly fit into boxes, including feminist ones, even while being unmistakably feminist. She wasn’t creating ideals or role models, but specific women in specific places (villages, streets, beaches) who are navigating a world in which the very definitions of women, of the feminine and of femininity are in upheaval. She was after the
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  contradictions
 </em>
 , a word that appears in many of her interviews, between clichés and “the images of lived life.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This wasn’t necessarily what the industry was interested in, and sometimes Varda directed short movies “to keep alive in my own research” as she once put it. The latter-life acclaim and honors were overdue and welcome —
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.oscars.org/governors-awards/agnes-varda" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  she clearly enjoyed being feted
 </a>
 — but she didn’t always have institutional and critical support. In the early 1980s, she spoke about being omitted from history books and from special issues of Cahiers du Cinéma dedicated to French cinema. “I was just plain forgotten,” she said. She kept going even if, as she admitted in 1986, with each film she had “to fight like a tiger.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 That year, one of her most critically and commercially
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/16/movies/screen-agnes-varda-s-vagabond.html?module=inline" title="a review">
  successful films, “Vagabond,”
 </a>
 about a dangerously unsettled woman, was released in the United States. I distinctly remember being freaked out by “Vagabond,” which opens on the corpse of Mona (a blazing Sandrine Bonnaire), a drifter who freezes to death in a country ditch. Raw, opaque yet also deeply moving, the film tracks her as she wanders from place to place, person to person, alone and finally unknowable. She’s a startlingly uncommon cinematic creation, partly because she is a woman who says no, including to other people.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Varda said she didn’t know why Mona repeatedly said no, a refusal that ends in death. I see “Vagabond,” in part, as a tough, unsentimental exploration about the limits of radical independence for women, which is perhaps what gives it the autobiographical aspect that runs through her movies. Varda’s life and work are filled with contrasts between interiority and exteriority, individuals and their worlds, which makes her house on Rue Daguerre, with its pink facade and striped doors, feel like another auteurist creation.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 For the past few years, my friend Joan Dupont and I would have an annual lunch with Varda at her home, eating and talking while periodically visited by one of her cats. She was predictably funny and warm and brilliant, but also sharp and strong and willful. During our lunch last year, Varda said she was tired. But she was as voluble as ever and filled with plans. She reminisced about her mother, who loved art, and her father, who didn’t, and spoke about growing old. “Never complain, never explain,” she said. She asked me about Ava DuVernay. The next week, Varda was off to the Cannes Film Festival, where she presented a restoration of her 1977 film “One Sings, the Other Doesn’t.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 At Cannes, she joined DuVernay and Cate Blanchett on the festival’s red carpet, this time to
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/12/movies/cannes-women-protest.html?module=inline" title="">
  protest gender inequality at the festival
 </a>
 . It was gratifying and deeply moving to see her among all these other women, though I wondered how many understood what Varda — through her example, her will and her art — had done to pave the way for them. In very concrete ways, in film after film, she helped show women that there was a place for them in movies beyond that of the inevitably beautiful, inevitably young star.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 At the end of “The Beaches of Agnès,” Varda asks, “What is cinema?” repeating André Bazin’s essential question. She is standing in one of the witty structures — a house of cinema — that she had fabricated for her multimedia installations. Cinema is light, images, dark, color, she says, over shots of the edifice with its metal frame and walls of film strips. Soon, she is inside. “In here, it feels like I live in cinema, cinema is my home,” she says. “I think I’ve always lived in it.” In the last shot, Varda is looking directly at the camera — at us — framed in an open door that feels like an invitation.

 Along with “Astro Boy” and “Speed Racer,” the 1960s live-action superhero series “Ultraman” was one of the first Japanese TV programs to reach a mainstream audience worldwide. In its homeland, this tale of a gigantic armored alien and his symbiotic human companion has inspired sequels and spinoffs galore, including a current manga series that follows the adventures of the original hero’s son. That comic has been adapted to this new animated TV series, which blends traditional anime techniques with CGI.

 The special Christmas episode of “Chilling Adventures of Sabrina” that arrived in mid-December of 2018 offered a brief respite in the ongoing saga of the well-meaning teenage witch, Sabrina Spellman (played by Kiernan Shipka). But as part two of the series’ first season begins, the heroine finds herself back in a mess of her own making. She’s tapped into demonic powers to help her friends, and is now having trouble keeping her darker impulses in check. As with the season’s first half, expect story lines that evoke Harry Potter and “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” with an eerily beautiful visual style that resembles “Rosemary’s Baby” and Hammer horror films.

 ” developed a small but fervent fan following over the course of its five seasons, telling strange, sardonic stories about how society might adjust to a zombie apocalypse. The prequel spinoff “Black Summer” circles back to the beginning of the outbreak, following a mother (played by Jaime King) who’s trying to find her way to her daughter, dodging the undead while forging relationships with other survivors who’ve been left behind. The new show is being pitched as a more traditional thriller, replacing wry humor with white-knuckle chases and narrow escapes.

 The Netflix series “Chef’s Table” sets a new standard for how TV shows about cooking could look and feel, bringing psychological depth and visual lyricism to the subject of food. Some of the “Chef’s Table” creative team will now take that same approach to the world’s street vendors in “Street Food,” a series focusing on the culture of entire cities and countries — including Singapore and India, in season one — rather than on the habits and obsessions of individual chefs.

 The rebooted version of the clunky ‘80s syndicated cartoon “She-Ra: Princess of Power” was one of 2018’s most pleasant TV surprises: a fusion of the original’s old-fashioned science-fiction/fantasy mythology with the cultural diversity, emotional richness and character-driven storytelling of more modern animated series. Even the name was changed, to reflect a premise that surrounds the title heroine with multiple magical warriors. Having introduced a teeming cast of complicated heroes and villains in season one, the series’ creator Noelle Stevenson and her staff of writers and illustrators will in year two be looking to put them into action in stories with more epic sweep.

 Brie Larson is having a stellar 2019 so far, first starring in the international box-office smash “Captain Marvel,” and now seeing her 2017 directorial debut “Unicorn Store” finally get distribution via Netflix. Written by Samantha McIntyre, “Unicorn Store” stars Larson as Kit, an aimless, artsy young woman, who’s just about to settle for a dull-but-stable life in a corporate cubicle when she gets an offer from a mysterious stranger (played by Samuel L. Jackson), who says he can sell her a unicorn. The film’s quirkily colorful images are in service of a whimsical story, meant to raise questions about what it means — realistically — to “follow your dream.”

Tuneful, stylish and masterfully acted, “La La Land” is a wonderful throwback to the best of classic Hollywood and the French New Wave.

 After directing some of the best-loved comedies of the 21st century — including “Anchorman,” “Talladega Nights” and “Step Brothers” — Adam McKay tried something different with 2015’s “The Big Short,” an adaptation of Michael Lewis’ nonfiction book about the 2008 financial crisis. An all-star cast that includes Brad Pitt, Ryan Gosling, Steve Carell and an Oscar-nominated Christian Bale help McKay and his fellow screenwriter Charles Randolph tell a complicated story about the people who predicted the market crash, and who made a lot of money thanks to flaws in the system. This is a lively, frequently funny movie, with a point to make about how everyday folks are often lied to and betrayed by politicians and pundits.

But “The Silence” is actually based on a Tim Lebbon novel, which predates “A Quiet Place.” Stanley Tucci plays the heroic patriarch, while Kiernan Shipka plays his daughter, whose other senses have been heightened since she lost her hearing at 13. The veteran horror cinematographer and director John R. Leonetti directs, from a script by Dick Van Dyke’s grandchildren, Carey and Shane Van Dyke.

When Rodriguez’s pop-culture reporter character Jenny gets a job at a magazine in San Francisco, she and her two best pals — played by DeWanda Wise and Brittany Snow — have one last wild romp together in New York City to help Jenny to get over her heartbreak and to bid her a spectacular farewell.

 The Korean pop singer Lee Ji-eun — sometimes professionally known as IU — plays four different characters in “Persona,” a collection of short films by up-and-coming Korean directors. In “Love Set,” “Collector,” “Kiss Burn” and “Walking at Night,” Lee plays the lead in everything from a tennis drama to a surreal romance, in stories that shift from light comedy to something more gripping. This project is a change of pace for the musician, who’s been a staple on television in her home country for years, but has less experience making movies.

 The loud-voiced comic Tim Robinson is probably best-known for cocreating and co-starring in the sweetly eccentric sitcom “Detroiters,” with his friend Sam Richardson. But he also spent a few years as a writer and an occasional bit player on “Saturday Night Live.” Robinson puts that sketch training to use — along with his ability to make a strong, not always positive first impression — in the offbeat cringe-comedy show “I Think You Should Leave.” In a variety of scenarios, Robinson and others play characters so obnoxious and intense that they drive anyone in the immediate vicinity into fleeing.

 the early ’90s saw a mini-wave of black filmmakers telling their own stories. None did so with more urgency than John Singleton, a recent University of Southern California grad whose debut feature, “Boyz N the Hood,” was a type of coming-of-age story that mainstream audiences had rarely seen before. A then-unknown Cuba Gooding Jr. stars as a teenager sent to live in the Crenshaw neighborhood of South-Central Los Angeles with his father (Laurence Fishburne), who teaches him the ins and outs of this difficult environment.

 The iconoclastic German director Wim Wenders is most noted for the 1987 art house sensation “Wings of Desire,” a black-and-white fantasy about angels in Berlin, observing the spiritual struggle of the mortals below. It’s fascinating to see Wenders bring that curiosity to “Pope Francis: A Man of His Word,” a documentary profile of a pontiff who’s responsible for tending the souls of millions. Wenders’s approach is perhaps too reverential, but he gets substantial interview time with Pope Francis and deftly underscores the modest, empathetic message he’s trying to send around the world.

 It took a while for Brie Larson’s directorial debut to find a home after premiering at the Toronto Film Festival in 2017, but Netflix has seized on her momentum post-“Captain Marvel,” as well as her buddy chemistry with Samuel L. Jackson, who co-stars in both films. Larson stars as a struggling artist who moves back home with her parents and takes a job at a P.R. firm as a grudging concession to adulthood. Her life changes, however, when a mystery man (Jackson) invites her to “The Store,” a place that allows her to sell whatever fantastical thing she wants. Given no restrictions, she turns to the whimsical creature she’s loved since childhood: the unicorn.

 The author Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette may be best known for her 1944 novella “Gigi,” which was adapted into an Oscar-winning musical a few years after she died. But the film “Colette” takes place much earlier, at the turn of the century, before she had the freedom to step out as an author. After marrying Henry Gauthier-Villars (Dominic West), a “literary entrepreneur” popularly known as Willy, Colette (Keira Knightley) takes up work as one of his team of uncredited ghostwriters. When stories from her schoolgirl days are assembled into a novel called “Claudine à l’école,” the book and its sequels become a cultural sensation, and she considers the difficult step of taking credit for it.

Brittany Snow and DeWanda Wise are the best friends who attempt to nurse her through her breakup by giving her a night on the town.

 Kindly received in 1994, Gillian Armstrong’s adaptation of the Louisa May Alcott classic is notable today as a remarkable incubator for young talent, with a cast that includes Winona Ryder, Samantha Mathis, Kirsten Dunst, Claire Danes and Christian Bale. As their father goes off to fight in the Civil War, the March sisters grow up with their mother (Susan Sarandon) in Concord, Mass., biding their time by performing original plays in their attic.

 It never seemed possible for Haruki Murakami’s delicate, whimsical storytelling style to translate to the screen, but Lee Chang-dong’s masterful “Burning,” based on a Murakami short story, coasts on those alluring qualities. Simply described, it sounds like a run-of-the-mill love triangle, with an attractive young woman (Jeon Jong-seo) courting interest from a taciturn former classmate (Yoo Ah-in) and a rich hipster (Steven Yeun) who’s hiding some dark secrets. But “Burning” unfolds like a mystery of human behavior, with Yeun a particular standout as a charming yet unmistakably sinister chaos agent with a Cheshire cat grin.

 After rolling out deeply flawed movies around label icons like Superman, Batman and Green Lantern, DC Comics finally connected with “Wonder Woman,” mostly because the film’s creators, the writer Allan Heinberg and the director Patty Jenkins, are so careful in sketching a character before diving into the CGI-heavy action. The first third of the film is the strongest, following the Amazon princess Diana (Gal Gadot) as she comes into her own among the women on the island of Themyscira. After finding her power, Diana gets whisked to World War I-era Europe, where she fights alongside an American pilot to put an end to the war — and the war god Ares, whom she holds responsible.

  “Planet Earth”

 and “Blue Planet” are visually lush yet sobering assessments of the natural world and the threats encroaching on it. “Our Planet” is another huge undertaking, an eight-episode series that was shot over four years in 50 countries, encompassing natural habitats from the rain forests to the seas. Picturesque nature documentaries tend to follow a certain formula — adorable or otherwise arresting animal footage, followed by a climate change update — but Attenborough has promised to make conservation a primary theme, urging viewers to act now to protect the environment.

 On the heels of “Black Mirror: Bandersnatch,” Netflix continues its experiments in interactive television with a clickable choose-your-own-adventure around Bear Grylls, the cheery survivalist best known for the Discovery Channel series “Man vs. Wild.” Over eight episodes, viewers are invited to direct Grylls’s actions on a series of adventures, presumably to get him out of various wilderness-related scrapes. Grylls is still alive, so no harm can come from choosing the wrong option, but the show stands to be a fascinating hybrid of nature documentary and stunt showmanship.

 Despite mixed reviews, the action-horror series “Z Nation” aired for five seasons on Syfy, focusing on the few humans to survive a zombie apocalypse that had claimed most of the population over the course of three years. The eight-episode “Black Summer” is considered a “companion prequel” to “Z Nation,” starting in the chaotic and gruesome days immediately following the outbreak. Jaime King stars as a mother who searches relentlessly for her missing daughter, joining a cadre of American refugees as they fight through the monster hordes. In the chaos, it’s not always easy to tell friend from undead foe.

 The French-Moroccan-Canadian comedian Gad Elmaleh has been called the Jerry Seinfeld of France for his stand-up act, which trades in a similar form of observational humor, and he’s been spending the last few years trying to break into Hollywood. “Huge in France” is Elmaleh’s television roman à clef, complete with a cameo from Seinfeld refuting the comparison. The series is about the humbling reality of a star who gets a constant “no” to the “Do you know who I am?” question, and who struggles to reconnect with his estranged son, a 16-year-old male model. Expect a fish-out-of-water comedy with loads of self-deprecation.

 Rightor Doyle steps behind the camera for the irreverent comedy series “Bonding,” based on his life experiences. The show starts with the reunion of two former high school friends: Pete (Brendan Scannell), a recently out gay man with few job prospects, and Tiff (Zoe Levin), a graduate student who moonlights as one of New York City’s premier dominatrixes. Tiff hires the hapless Pete to be her assistant — part bodyguard, part cleanup man and all-around support system — but the job leads him on some humiliating misadventures.

 This vivid, evocative memory play from Alfonso Cuarón is a story of two Mexican women in the early 1970s: Sofía (Marina de Tavira), a mother of four whose husband (and provider) is on his way out the door, and Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio), the family’s nanny, maid and support system. His scenes are occasionally stressful, often heart-wrenching, and they unfailingly burst with life and emotion. Our critic called it “

 A young boy’s search for his mysterious heritage and his musical voice takes him, quite literally, beyond this world in this charming, touching and joyful treat from Disney and Pixar. Set in Mexico on the Day of the Dead, the screenplay (by co-director Adrian Molina and Matthew Aldrich) cheerfully interweaves the traditions of the holiday and culture with its own rules of death and afterlife.

 In this, the eighth installment of the “Star Wars” saga, the writer-director Rian Johnson (“Looper”) bends the boundaries of the series in fascinating ways — tinkering with iconography, exploding expectations and taking the universe in unexpected directions. “The Last Jedi” delivers the blockbuster goods, with chases, dogfights and lightsaber battles galore. But it is also a subtle and thoughtful meditation on the franchise itself, and the necessity of storytellers who are willing to take big risks. Daisy Ridley, Oscar Isaac, and John Boyega all shine, but the powerhouse performer is Mark Hamill, who brings a lifetime of hope and disappointment to his long-awaited revival of Luke Skywalker.

 The latest from Joel and Ethan Coen is an anthology film set in the Old West, a series of stories of varying length and style, some as short and simple as jokes, others with the richness and depth of a great short story. Our critic wrote, “

  It swerves from goofy to ghastly so deftly and so often that you can’t always tell which is which

 Director David Fincher’s breakthrough film was the serial-killer thriller “Seven,” but he had no intention of repeating himself with this 2007 mystery. Because the real-life Zodiac killer was never apprehended or tried for his crime, Fincher sidestepped the big payoff of most true crime stories, crafting instead a film that focuses on the kind of obsessiveness it takes to follow that trail, year after year, without a satisfactory conclusion.

 Flint Lockwood (energetically voiced by Bill Hader) creates a satellite that can turn water into food, transforming his forgotten fishing island into a gourmet destination and a tourist hot spot. But when the portions start to mutate into oversized super-foods, Flint has to find the courage to finish what he started. Anna Farris, James Caan, Mr. T and Bruce Campbell are the standouts in the voice cast, and while the little ones will love the images of hot dogs and spaghetti falling from the sky, there’s also a lesson to learn about being yourself and doing what’s right.

 This 2004 breakthrough film by Michel Gondry is a miraculous combination of science fiction ideas, romantic-comedy meet-cutes and lovelorn drama, somehow delivering on all counts. Working from a typically clever screenplay by Charlie Kaufman (“Being John Malkovich”), he tells the story of a perpetual sad sack (Jim Carrey) who subjects himself to an experimental procedure in hopes of erasing all memory of his ex-girlfriend (Kate Winslet).

 Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti shine as two New York creative types whose attempts to start a family — by adoption, by fertilization, by whatever it takes — test the mettle of their relationships and sanity. The wise script by the director Tamara Jenkins is not only funny and truthful but also sharply tuned to their specific world: Few films have better captured the very public nature of marital trouble in New York, when every meltdown is interrupted by passers-by and looky-loos. “Private Life,” which our critic called “
 <a href="https://nyti.ms/2OznfCo">

 So much of this 1981 Steven Spielberg adventure has entered the realm of pop culture immortality — the rolling boulder, the melting Nazi face, the truck chase — that it’s easy to forget how fleet-footed, fresh and funny it is.

 The British comedy troupe Monty Python created its funniest, wildest and cult-friendliest feature-length comedy with this 1975 send-up of the legend of King Arthur — and of medieval literature in general, and of big-screen epics.

 Over a 12-year period, the director Richard Linklater surreptitiously constructed “Boyhood” around the non-actor Ellar Coltrane, folding that boy’s development from age 6 to 18 into a fictional narrative about growing up under a devoted single mother (Patricia Arquette) and a father (Ethan Hawke) whose presence in his life is much less consistent. Watching Coltrane age is a uniquely powerful experience by itself, but Linklater keeps the frame open to larger developments in culture and politics, too, as well as to the particulars of family life in Texas. Manohla Dargis called it “

 A Puritan family, banished to the woods of New England by its community, encounters a frightening force of true evil in this potent mixture of art-house drama and supernatural thriller from the writer and director Robert Eggers.

 Three crime stories — a hit man out to dinner with his boss’s wife, a boxer who decides not to throw the big fight and a contract killing gone awry — are shuffled like cards in a deck, told out of order and with delightful narrative curveballs in this 1994 hodgepodge from the writer-director Quentin Tarantino. He writes the kind of tasty, self-aware dialogue that actors love to devour, and he puts together an enviable ensemble cast of big names, fallen stars and rising talents to deliver it.

 Joel and Ethan Coen won their first Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director (and their second for Best Screenplay) for this gripping, moody, and darkly funny adaptation of Cormac McCarthy’s

 . Telling the stories of a ruthless killer (Javier Bardem, who took home an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor), a morally flexible rancher (Josh Brolin) and a small-town sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) whose paths cross when a border drug deal goes south, the Coens construct a Western contemporary in both its setting and style, setting the table for the standard stand-offs and shoot-outs, then turning those expectations inside out.

 A 52-year-old Georgian woman shocks her family, and her entire community, when she decides to move out of the cramped family apartment — leaving her husband, children and parents behind in order to finally begin a life of her own. “In this world, there are no families without problems,” she is told, and the conflicts of the script by Nana Ekvtimishvili (who also directed, with Simon Gross) are a sharp reminder that while the cultural specifics may vary, familial guilt and passive aggression are bound by no language.

 “This here's Miss Bonnie Parker. I'm Clyde Barrow. We rob banks.” With those simple but accurate words, the producer and star Warren Beatty helped kick off a whole new movement of subversive, challenging, youth-oriented moviemaking. Directed by Arthur Penn, the film initially received mixed criticism — our critic dismissed it as “
 <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1967/08/14/83631726.html">
  a cheap piece of bald-faced slapstick
 </a>
 ” — but in the passing years, its power and influence became undeniable. Every performance is a gem, but Beatty and Faye Dunaway rarely rose to this level in their other work, mixing sexuality, danger, restlessness and ennui.

 Ava DuVernay (“Selma”) directs this wide-ranging deep dive into mass incarceration, tracing the advent of America’s overcrowded (and disproportionately minority-filled) modern prison system back to the 13th Amendment of the United States Constitution. It’s a giant topic to take on in 100 minutes, and DuVernay understandably has to do some skimming and slicing. But that necessity engenders its style: “13TH” tears through history with a palpable urgency that pairs nicely with its righteous fury. Our critic called it “

 Steven Spielberg had only a single feature and a handful of TV credits to his name when he was handed the task of adapting a pulpy best seller about a killer shark. The famously troubled production, which went weeks over schedule and millions over budget, forced the director to rely more on suspense and characterization than on special effects. The rest is

 Paying loving tribute to the exploitation movies of multiple eras and cultures, this double-feature dabbles in kung fu, anime, spaghetti Western and blaxploitation, its writer/director Quentin Tarantino deliriously hopping styles like a movie-crazy kid swapping out VHS tapes. But in all the pyrotechnics, he maintains his gift for quotable dialogue and charismatic characters, ending his blood-soaked saga with on a surprisingly warm and human note. Our critics praised the “

 Winner of the Oscar for best picture of 2009 (and for best director for Kathryn Bigelow), this harrowing war drama concerns a team of specialists trained in on-the-ground bomb diffusion in Iraq — with a particular focus on Staff Sgt. William James (Jeremy Renner), who’s a bit of a loose cannon. Bigelow mines palpable, sweaty tension from this terrifying work, but she doesn’t settle for cheap thrills; the film is most intense when dealing with James’s internal conflicts and his psychological battles with his team. Manohla Dargis called it “

 Steve Carell’s wide-eyed leading work in the title role of this 2005 romantic comedy made him a star; it also turned the writer-director

 Francis Ford Coppola’s loose, Vietnam-era adaptation of Joseph Conrad’s “Heart of Darkness” was a notoriously troubled production, harassed by weather woes, political struggles, budget and schedule overages, and problems with actors. Considering how much drama occurred offscreen, it’s somewhat miraculous that the final product is so singular and powerful — an awe-inspiring fusion of ’60s psychedelic film, ’70s genre reimagining and classic wide-screen epic. Our critic called it “

 Paul Newman turns in one of his most iconic performances as the former war hero Lucas Jackson, whose tenacious, rascally free spirit and refusal to kowtow to authority maddens his keepers on a Florida chain gang — and inspires his fellow prisoners.

 Ang Lee won the academy award for best director for this enthralling mixture of martial arts adventure and heartfelt romance. His narrative is a busy hive of deception, betrayal, loyalty and pride, and while the personal and emotional stakes are high, “Crouching Tiger” is most memorable for its awe-inspiring action sequences — bone-crunching and balletic, thrilling and lyrical, as heroes and villains alike transcend gravity itself.

 As Netflix pours more of its resources into original content, Amazon Prime Video is picking up the slack, adding new movies for its subscribers each month. Its catalog has grown so impressive, in fact, that it’s a bit overwhelming — and at the same time, movies that are included with a Prime subscription regularly change status, becoming available only for rental or purchase.

 Two “lifers,” locked up together indefinitely in Shawshank prison, form a bond that transcends decades of their lives and, ultimately, their own incarcerations in this heart-wrenching adaptation of an atypically non-genre novella by Stephen King. Tim Robbins is in fine form as Andy Dufresne, convicted of a crime he didn’t commit and dedicated to proving it. As Red, the guy who can get anything for anybody, Morgan Freeman (who also narrates) crafts the quintessential Morgan Freeman performance: folksy and friendly, but with a layer of steel underneath.

 Two jazz musicians (Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis) disguise themselves in drag to escape some gangsters, but one of them falls for a seductive singer (Marilyn Monroe, in one of her best performances), while the other becomes the object of a millionaire’s desire.

 Jodie Foster won her first Academy Award for her forceful turn as a rape victim in this brutal but essential drama. It’s a hard film to watch, particularly in its relentless dramatizations of the assault, and yet it is not without hope or catharsis, and it prompts fascinating (and still very poignant) questions about responsibility, harassment and victim blaming. Foster’s performance is still a stunner: Detailed and grounded, her character refuses to pander for sympathy or “likability.” Our critic deemed it “

 The director Frank Capra and the actor Jimmy Stewart took a marvelously simple premise — a suicidal man is given the opportunity to see what his world would have been like without him — and turned it into a holiday perennial. But “It’s a Wonderful Life” is too rich and complex to brand with a label as simple as “Christmas movie”; it is ultimately a story about overcoming darkness and finding light around you, a tricky transition achieved primarily through the peerless work of Stewart as a good man with big dreams who can’t walk away from the place where he’s needed most.

 Roman Polanski’s brings a 1970s sensibility to a classic 1940s private eye movie, and explores the tension between those two eras — between what we were traditionally shown and the sex, drugs and moral rot that production codes kept off-screen. Jack Nicholson crafts one of his finest performances as J.J. Gittes, a laid-back Los Angeles gumshoe who gets in way over his head, while Faye Dunaway takes the conventions of the slinky femme fatale and turns them into a portrait of genuine pain and abuse.

 Greta Gerwig made her solo feature directorial debut with this funny and piercing coming-of-age story, set in her hometown, Sacramento, Calif. Saoirse Ronan dazzles in the titular role as a quietly rebellious high-school senior whose quests for love and popularity bring her long-simmering resentments toward her mother (Laurie Metcalf, magnificent) to a boil. Parent-child conflicts are nothing new in teen stories, but Gerwig’s perceptive screenplay slashes through the familiar types and tropes, daring to create characters that are complicated and flawed, yet deeply sympathetic.

 This classic 1952 Western from the director Fred Zinnemann is best remembered for its innovative construction, in which a small-town marshal’s looming standoff with a revenge-seeking outlaw is dramatized in real time. The film was widely read as an allegory for the film industry blacklists of the era — the screenwriter Carl Foreman was deemed an “uncooperative witness” by the House Un-American Activities Committee. But “High Noon” also cleared an important path for the future of the Western, replacing the usual genre high jinks with thoughtful explorations of masculinity and violence; our critic called it “

 South Korean master Park Chan-wook (“Oldboy”) takes the stylistic trappings of a period romance and gooses them with scorching eroticism and one of the most ingenious con-artist plots this side of “The Sting.” Working from the Sarah Waters novel “Fingersmith,” Park begins with the story of a young woman who, as part of a seemingly straightforward swindle, goes to work as a Japanese heiress’s handmaiden, occasionally pausing the plot to slyly reveal new information, reframing what we’ve seen and where we think he might go next.

 Directed by Howard Hawks, this 1940 film wasn’t the first cinematic adaptation of the popular play “The Front Page,” but it cooked up a twist the 1931 version hadn’t: What if Hildy Johnson, the superstar reporter whom the ruthless editor Walter Burns will keep on his staff at any cost, wasn’t his drinking buddy but his ex-wife? It’s a movie that talks fast and moves faster, and the passage of nearly 80 years hasn’t slowed it down a bit. Our critic called it “a bold-faced reprint of what was once—and still remains—

 Between the first two “Godfather” epics, Francis Ford Coppola wrote and directed this modest character study, in which a proudly impersonal surveillance expert (Gene Hackman) becomes unexpectedly invested in the subjects of his work and then decides he must step in to save their lives. Like its protagonist, “The Conversation” is most riveting in its quietest moments, though its bold opening sequence — in which Caul attempts to eavesdrop on a whispered conversation in a crowded park — is both brilliant filmmaking and a riveting snapshot of Watergate-era America.

 This vibrant and playful 2017 exploration of the life of Emily Dickinson comes from the fertile mind of the great British writer and director Terence Davies (“The Deep Blue Sea”), who so frequently and masterfully unearths the raw desires and emotional truths of the periods he explores.

So he went all-in on pathos, creating a story in which his iconic Little Tramp character discovers an abandoned baby, raises the child as his own and must then summon all his ingenuity to keep their makeshift family intact. Even this first time out, Chaplin juggles the seemingly incongruent tones with ease. Our critic praised Chaplin’s “

 Emily V. Gordon and Kumail Nanjiani based their first screenplay on their own, unconventional love story — a courtship that was paused, then oddly amplified by an unexpected illness and a medically induced coma. This isn’t typical rom-com fodder, but it’s written and played with such honesty and heart that it somehow lands. Nanjiani and Zoe Kazan (standing in for Gordon) generate easy, lived-in chemistry and a rooting interest in the relationship, while a second-act appearance by Holly Hunter and Ray Romano as her parents creates a prickly tension that gives way to hard-won affection. Our critic deemed it “

 The first two collaborations between Clint Eastwood and director Sergio Leone, “A Fistful of Dollars” and “A Few Dollars More,” did nothing less than reinvent a genre, diverting popular attention from the increasingly stodgy traditional Western to the so-called “

 John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd kicked off the tradition of translating “Saturday Night Live” characters to the big screen with this outsized musical-action-comedy from the director John Landis (“Animal House”). The plot is old hat: The title characters try to put their old band back together in order to save their childhood orphanage. But it proves to be an ingenious clothesline upon which Aykroyd and Landis’s script can hang a serious of rousing musical numbers and car-crunching chase scenes. Our critic called those sequences “

 The director John Schlesinger captures the sights and sounds (and practically the smells) of Times Square in the late 1960s with this absorbing winner of the Oscar for Best Picture — the first and only X-rated movie to capture that prize. Jon Voight was propelled to stardom by his charming performance as Joe Buck, a naïve Texas boy who comes to New York City with visions of rich women in his head; Dustin Hoffman created another memorable character as the street-wise native who shows him the ropes.

 This Polish possession story from the writer and director Marcin Wrona opens on a note of uncertainty and dread and then holds it for 94 harrowing minutes. Wrona transforms the relatable fears of wedding day into something far more sinister, as our groom protagonist discovers horrifying skeletons in his new family’s closet (or, more accurately, its yard); the filmmaker offsets the considerable nightmare imagery and wild-eyed desperation with piercing moments of gallows humor, particularly in contemplating how “sensible people” might react to these events. Our critic praised its “

 — but that doesn’t mean the original movie version has lost its bite. Directed by Sidney Lumet, the film follows Howard Beale (Peter Finch), a land mine of a news anchor who, after learning that he is to be fired, goes on live TV and tells the county that he plans to commit suicide on air. He doesn’t do it, but the episode garners high ratings, saving Beale’s job and shaping the tenor of his subsequent newscasts, which become increasingly intense. Faye Dunaway plays a network executive. Dunaway and Finch won Oscars for their performances, as did Beatrice Straight, for a supporting role, and Chayefsky, for his screenplay. The film now runs alongside the very kinds of programming it seeks to skewer.

 Throughout the 2000s, Matt Damon’s amnesiac ex-C.I.A. operative Jason Bourne captured attention with few words. The cold, often intimate violence dispatched by Damon’s quiet antihero in “The Bourne Identity” (2002), “The Bourne Supremacy” (2004) and “The Bourne Ultimatum” (2007) helped define action movies of the era. After nine years off, Damon

 The same year Jason Bourne arrived on the spy-movie scene to ramp up the violence and pare down excesses of the genre, Pierce Brosnan was firing rockets from an invisible car and fencing with an instructor played by Madonna in this, his final turn as James Bond.

 Every spring, the Museum of Modern Art and the Film Society of Lincoln Center present New Yorkers with the cinematic miscellany known as New Directors/New Films. This year’s program of movies, many gleaned from the international festival circuit, runs the gamut from the glorious to the grim and includes works of socially conscious realism, historical fantasy and experimental documentary. Our chief film critics, Manohla Dargis and A.O. Scott, offer these highlights.

 Some time in the 18th century, a young African boy is purchased by a European noblewoman and subjected to a curious form of enslavement. Given the name Angelo, he grows up among aristocrats who treat him not as a servant but as a curio and a symbol of their own benevolence. Angelo’s biography feels like both a plausibly factual chronicle and a fantastical allegory. Shot with classical rigor and attention to detail (with room for a few telling anachronisms), the Austrian filmmaker Markus Schleinzer’s second feature presents history as a lavish, lucid nightmare from which nobody, Angelo least of all, can hope to awaken. (A.O. Scott)

 A tale twice told, the ingenious Turkish puzzle “Belonging” opens with an unseen narrator introducing the story and then another voice delivering a just-the-facts description of a murder. Detailed, largely affectless and sometimes rushed, this recitation accompanies images that initially seem completely unrelated, even random. In time, though, words and images begin syncing up — we hear “the security chain was locked” over a shot of a safety chain lock — creating a seamless correspondence between what we hear and see. The writer-director Burak Cevik then flips the switch and the movie shifts into a more lyrical narrative register, one that fills in all the little nuances, most notably the intimate in-between moments that both explain and obscure so much.

 shows signs of Martel’s influence in its blend of oblique narration and subtle psychological insight. But Alché, who is also an accomplished photographer, brings her own arresting visual sensibility to this story of grief, longing and memory. Mercedes Moran plays a middle-aged mother of three almost-grown children who is thrown off balance by the death of her sister. During her mourning period, nothing much happens, and yet everything happens, as Alché and Moran practice a kind of emotional sonar, picking up signals that lie deep under the dramatic surface.

 The documentary “Honeyland” contains worlds in one beautiful, seemingly simple story. Its focus, Hatidze Muratova, lives in a tiny stone house in remote northern Macedonia with her octogenarian mother, a plucky dog and an irregular number of cats. Her passion and apparent livelihood, though, are the wild bees she tends —

 is too possessive — with hand flaps, vocalizations and deep respect. The directors Ljubomir Stefanov and Tamara Kotevska don’t overexplain this world, its history or seemingly fragile present, including the origin of the chaotic, sprawling family who soon moves in and begins taking over the bees. The family’s at times infuriating disruptions (animal lovers beware) turn this quiet, moving observational documentary into a heart-skipping thriller as well as a perfect encapsulation of humanity’s catastrophic domination of nature.

 During the Kosovo war in 1999, against a backdrop of NATO bombardment, a Serbian truck driver (Leon Lucev), transports a mysterious cargo toward Belgrade. He gives a ride to a young man whose reasons for traveling are equally enigmatic, and the two of them make their way across a chilly, drab landscape in this mordant, minimalist road picture, directed by Ognjen Glavonic, who leavens the journey with hints of suspense and glints of absurdist humor. This isn’t “The Wages of Fear” so much as the dividends of existential anxiety and political despair. (A.O.S.)

 If it bleeds, it leads — and pays the bills. That’s the uneasy truism and slow-boiling moral of the gripping documentary “Midnight Family,” about a household of ambulance workers. The title isn’t metaphoric (or not exactly), but refers to the Ochoas, who operate one of the many private ambulances that race through Mexico City. Fantastically shot by the director Luke Lorentzen, the documentary develops an urgency that suits the life-or-death stakes onscreen. By turns terrifying and exhilarating, “Midnight Family” unfolds with such velocity that it may take a while for your ethical doubts to catch up to what’s happening. When they do, they leave you gasping. (M.D.)

 The pig’s head on a stick, posted in a jungle encampment occupied by a pack of feral children, pays obvious homage to “Lord of the Flies.” But Alejandro Landes’s “Monos” infuses the themes of that schoolboy parable with a grim, contemporary political perspective and filters them through cinematic influences that include Terrence Malick and Werner Herzog. The kids are members of a guerrilla army in the Colombian countryside. Their mission is to guard an American hostage played by Julianne Nicholson. A lot goes wrong. As the action shifts from mountains to rain forest, Landes makes clever use of drone-mounted cameras and trippy sound design to turn the natural world into a hallucination. Unless the human characters are figments dreamed up by the landscape. (A.O.S.)

Making a fine feature debut, the American Pippa Bianco uses a depressingly familiar story of high-school partying gone wrong to explore sometimes uncomfortable questions about gender, agency and collective guilt.

 Time bends in this sly, often-lovely drama, which pivots on a young surveyor whose past catches up with him while he’s out in the field. At one point, he walks into a seemingly deserted classroom, initiating an enigmatic journey into the past that keeps bumping into the present. Using splashes of primary color, punctuating zooms, visual echoes and narrative ellipses, the Chinese writer-director Qiu Sheng puts a fresh gloss on Faulkner’s observation that the past is never dead. It’s always here, vibrating in every red scarf, bird song and moment. “Suburban Birds” will open soon, but is so good — and delightfully kinked — that it’s well worth catching now (and watching twice). (M.D.)

 When we last left Sabrina, she signed her name in the Book of the Beast. Now what? As we enter Season 2 — or Part 2, as Netflix likes to call it; or Phase 2, as the Dark Lord himself might dub his diabolic plan for our favorite teenage witch — Sabrina is starting to raise a little hell. Her devotion to the Dark Lord and her aptitude for magic itself are both put to the test when she confronts the inherent misogyny of the witch world. (Why is everything tipped in favor of the warlocks?) There are some clever horror in-jokes this season, and some spot-on guest stars familiar to the genre (Veronica Cartwright, Ray Wise). So tune in for more ominous intrigue, sexy interludes with the studly Nick Scratch and some facetime with Satan himself. Let the half-breed ascend!

 There is something beautifully soothing — and tragic, too — about the remarkable imagery on display in this globe-spanning wildlife series, which captures rare animals in their remote habitats. Thousands of pink flamingos, for example, take over a newly formed lake in an African salt pan after a torrential rain, a place where they can breed safely, away from predators. It’s a delight to see the flamingo chicks learning to walk out of there — until the focus shifts to the one that can’t keep up because the salt has solidified around its tiny limbs like crusty leg warmers. The narrator David Attenborough’s voice is warmly reassuring, even when telling us that wildlife populations are in decline. “For the first time in human history,” he says, “the stability of nature can no longer be taken for granted.” Here’s a chance to see it while you can.

 This sweet, funny movie raises an unavoidable question for the writer-director Jennifer Kaytin Robinson: Why would present-day New York music journalist Jenny (Gina Rodriguez) want to move to San Francisco to work for Rolling Stone, when Rolling Stone hasn’t been headquartered in San Francisco for more than 40 years? If you can set that aside, the rest of Jenny’s story might draw you in. The move to the West Coast brings a breakup with her boyfriend Nate (Lakeith Stanfield), and a heartbroken Jenny and her two BFFs (DeWanda Wise, Brittany Snow) decide to commiserate by spending the day (and night) playing hooky, getting high, and generally not acting their age. This is a celebration of female friendship and a bittersweet contemplation of receding youth, as Jenny is compelled to say goodbye to New York, goodbye to her twenties and of course, goodbye to Nate, with his limpid, soulful eyes.

 Two grieving parents (Uma Thurman, Tony Goldwyn) track down the teenage girl who was the recipient of their deceased daughter’s heart and begin generously giving her more things — fine clothes, a car, a full scholarship to a pricey private school. But the girl, Sasha (actress Sivan Alyra Rose), is a little weirded out by the parents’ unsolicited beneficence. And as she becomes further enmeshed in the life her young donor left behind, strange things begin happening. She becomes ambidextrous. She hears The Stone Roses playing when the radio’s not on. She has sudden violent impulses. Set against a Southwestern landscape, this horror series is disturbing, addictive and moody.

 Last season’s nemesis, The Terror, has been rooted out and our unlikely blue do-gooder The Tick is back for another round of hyper-stylized superhero satire. This time he’s tackling government lies, human trafficking and other things of a murder-y nature. The Tick is so busy that his sidekick, Arthur, however, is having serious trouble keeping up. Arthur has poor danger reflexes, secret identity issues and a new nemesis called Lobstercules. There are also other heroes on hand (for team-ups) and several new villains. Haven’t seen Season 1, you say? No problem — this second outing is super easy to follow.

 The new season of Wyatt Cenac’s docu-series focuses on the American education system and why it seems so broken. (And with the recent admissions scandals, he drolly notes, even bribing your child’s way into an education appears to be broken, too.) Cenac talks to students, educators, historians and others about issues like school unionization, the undervaluing of teachers and the school-to-prison pipeline. The series isn’t all hard slogging, though; Cenac also explores things like goat yoga classes, which can only be called amusing.

 Richard Wright’s celebrated 1940 novel receives its third screen adaptation by the artist and first-time director Rashid Johnson. Wright’s story has been updated (by the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Suzan-Lori Parks), but his protagonist Bigger Thomas (Ashton Sanders, so good in “Moonlight”), is still a young black man trapped in a world rigged against him. Bigger rejects the gangster lifestyle offered by a friend and thinks he’s found a way out of poverty in the South Side of Chicago when he gets a job as a driver for a wealthy businessman, Henry Dalton (Bill Camp). But his dreams of self-improvement are doomed by his interactions with Dalton’s “woke” daughter Mary (Margaret Qualley), who is enamored by what she thinks Bigger represents. The movie isn’t a masterpiece, but it has much to admire: striking visual compositions, Sanders’s nuanced performance and a tense atmosphere which suggests much more than is said here.

 It’s 1832 in Halifax, West Yorkshire, England, and Anne Lister is determined to do whatever she very well pleases with her life. Driving a stagecoach, for example, or mercy-killing a horse — or dressing in masculine clothing and sleeping with women. Possibly even marrying one! Lister, a real-life historical figure, is widely considered to be the first modern lesbian, and this Anglo-American series, created by Sally Wainwright (“Happy Valley”) is miles away from the standard stuffy period drama, focusing, as it does, on the ways that its protagonist disrupted the conventions of her time. As played by Suranne Jones, Lister is charming and brilliant, dazzling others even when she’s not in the room, much to the consternation of her overlooked sister (Gemma Whelan). Scandalously good fun, this show.

 Ramy Hassan is going to die alone. Well, that’s what everybody keeps telling him. Ramy’s mother wants him to try picking up women at their local mosque in New Jersey, while one of his friends informs him that he’s running out of options (“There are only two hot Muslim girls left in town”). So naturally, Ramy is dating a Jewish woman. Ramy Youssef, the show’s star and creator, loosely based this half-hour comedy series on his own experiences as a first-generation Egyptian-American, and the humor comes from a very specific place. Balancing a spiritual life with a love life is both a serious issue and, as it turns out, a very funny one.

 It never really mattered what movie was playing at the 3,000-seat RKO Keith’s Theater in Flushing, Queens. The main attraction was always the theater itself.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “It was enormous, a true movie palace,” recalled Jim Driscoll, 74, a lifelong Flushing resident. “They had a blue ceiling with special lights that looked like twinkling stars.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Wendy Antos-Baker, 70, who lives in Whitestone, Queens, said that “it had a very, very ornate, lobby — it was almost ostentatious, unlike any theater you’d see today.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Even though it closed in 1986 and has been deteriorating ever since, many devotees have fought to preserve the RKO Keith’s, even as it was flipped among developers seeking to demolish it and transform it into residential or commercial property.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The latest attempt — by Xinyuan Real Estate, a Beijing-based developer — seems to be underway and the RKO Keith’s days finally may be numbered.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Every developer that came before us was playing games, looking to flip it, or slap up some building real fast,” said Eugene T. Kelty Jr., the chairman of the local community board. “Everyone took their profit and moved on. This is the only one who really wants to develop it.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The movie palace, Mr. Kelty said, was lovely, with an organ near the stage for pre-film entertainment.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But, he added, its time has passed.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “It was a beautiful theater, I’ll give you that, but people want to go back in time and bring it back, which is a nice wish, but it’s just not happening,’’ Mr. Kelty said. “Too much of it is already destroyed.’’
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Still, Richard Thornhill, a

 </a>
 , said that even in its decimated state, the theater can still be restored with help from photographs and by using the still-intact plans of its original designer, the renowned theater architect Thomas W. Lamb.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. Thornhill has helped collect about 4,400 signatures

 on a petition to convince

 the developer to build around the theater and enable a renovation that would put Queens on footing with other boroughs that have restored historic theaters, including Kings Theater in Brooklyn, Paradise Theater in the Bronx and St. George Theatre on Staten Island.
</p>
<p class="css-1plcdrk evys1bk0">
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  “Everything in the Keith’s theater was beautiful — the candy stand in the lobby, even the bathrooms. They had an organ player, and they’d always run two movies, an A movie and then a B movie. It’s a shame that these big theaters are really all gone now.”

 “We didn’t have television yet, so going to this magnificent movie house was a big deal,” said Claire K. Shulman, 93, who was the Queens borough president from 1986 until 2002.

</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 1A: Yes, The “Happening after the doors open on Black Friday” is technically a MAD DASH, but it’s really much worse than that, isn’t it? And it’s pretty much confined to the United States, although the concept of Black Friday has spread to other countries. Here, for example, is the difference between the beginning of a Black Friday shopping experience in Canada and one in the United States, where the first fight breaks out on the left side of your screen at about 1:10:
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 16A: Bonus points if you knew how to spell Ms. Ronan’s name without Googling it. Even though I’m a fan and have some inkling of how to spell her beautiful Irish name — SAOIRSE — I had to look it up.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 49D: Isn’t butterscotch more of a tan/brown color? I have never thought of it as ORANGE, but maybe I just see it differently.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Before we discuss the theme, I’m told that Across Lite might not be able to handle the entry of this theme if you use the intended symbol, but it will accept the answer if you type out the word or the first letter of that word.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. Adams offers us a set of three films that have right slashes in their titles, such as “FROST/NIXON,” and their crossers (while not films) have slashes as well. All of this is neatly tied up by the revealer at 25D, SLASHER FILM, which is normally a phrase that describes a movie with a lot of carnage in it.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 As Mr. Adams notes below, I was a bit concerned by the entry 7D, HE/SHE and its cluing, but I was excited that there might be a possibility that the crossers for these film titles related back to them. For example, the theme entry at 17A is “VICTOR/VICTORIA,” which, on its surface, is about Julie Andrews’s character cross-dressing to get a job, but is really a look at the spectrum of queerness.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Alas, they’re not all related, but they all work on their own.

  first
 </a>
 one was published. And like that puzzle, this one uses left/right symmetry because of the lengths of the theme answers. But as an
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://arctanxwords.blogspot.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  indie constructor
 </a>
 , I enjoy doing unconventional things to get themes to work, and I’m always pleased when they do.
</p>
<p class="css-1plcdrk evys1bk0">
 The hardest part of this one, by far, was fitting in the FACE/OFF entry. Because it’s an even-length answer, I couldn’t run it horizontally, so it had to go in the center column. And the left/right symmetry meant having two answers of (at minimum) eight letters flank it and intersect with whatever entry went through the slash. It took a lot of trial and error to get it to work, but I’m pleased with the result. That said, the shape of the center largely forced the rest of the grid, including making 7D six spaces long. (More on this in a bit.) I could have broken up the top two rows into three answers each, but I try to avoid too many shorter answers when possible, and I’m pleased with how these corners came out.
</p>
<p class="css-1plcdrk evys1bk0">
 And yet, I am a bit conflicted about 7D, HE/SHE. As clued, it’s a perfectly reasonable answer in that it is unquestionably a third-person pronoun. Many people will see no problem with this clue/answer combo and will move on without a second thought. But others won’t. I, for one, had some reservations about it then, and I don’t think I’d use this answer if I were making this puzzle today. When the puzzle was accepted, Will and his team agreed with me that this was a clue to handle delicately. After all, these pronouns are restrictive and needlessly exclude nonbinary people, and have largely been supplanted by the singular “they” anyway. There was a fair bit of discussion about how to address such concerns without writing a clue that was awkwardly worded or overly wordy, or that called too much attention to the answer. In the end, we agreed that, as written, the clue would work best for the previously mentioned reason: It works without distracting from the rest of the puzzle. Still, even though this issue is not addressed in the clue, I’m glad Will and his team took the time to discuss it carefully and to consider multiple viewpoints and suggestions.

 LOS ANGELES — The directors of "Avengers: Endgame" pleaded with fans on Tuesday not to spoil the movie by giving away storylines after reports that some scenes had leaked online.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In an open letter posted on Twitter under the hashtag #DontSpoilTheEndgame, Joe and Anthony Russo said they and the vast cast of the upcoming Marvel superhero movie "have worked tirelessly for the last three years with the sole intention of delivering a surprising and emotionally powerful conclusion" to the saga.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "When you see Endgame in coming weeks, please don't spoil it for others, the same way you wouldn't want it spoiled for you," they added.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Walt Disney Co's "Avengers: Endgame" marks the conclusion of a story told across 22 Marvel films. The plot has been shrouded in secrecy, with no advance screenings for the entertainment press. Sales of advance tickets earlier this month surpassed those of 2015 movie "Star Wars: The Force Awakens."
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The film, which brings together multiple comic book characters, starts its rollout on April 24 in Australia and China before arriving in the United States on April 25.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Some fans said on Tuesday they had seen brief, grainy scenes on Reddit, YouTube and other platforms, but the footage was swiftly removed. Reuters has not seen the leaked scenes and Disney declined to comment.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The #DontSpoilTheEnding hashtag was one of the top Twitter trends on Tuesday. Some fans who said they had viewed the leaks said they only increased their anticipation for the movie.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "I was upset for about 0.2 seconds then realized how cool it was and it made me so hyped," a person with the user name thestaggie posted on Reddit.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Chris Smith, a contributor to the BGR.com entertainment and tech news site, wrote that he had seen a leak but that it "doesn't really give away the ending" of the movie, although it contained scenes that had not been shown in any of the trailers or official clips released so far.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "I don’t consider that the leak has actually ruined the movie for me. It just makes me want to watch it even more than I already did," wrote Smith.

 MoviePass made waves when it launched, but it’s not the only movie subscription designed to lure you to the theater. Here are a few popular ones, who they’re for and whether you’ll save money with one.

 With the summer blockbuster season starting earlier than ever, an all-you-can-eat theater subscription sounds appealing. Then again so do gym memberships and
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/smarter-living/clothing-box-services-stitch-fix-trunk-club.html?module=inline" title="">
  subscription boxes
 </a>
 . Likewise, whether they’re worth it depends on how you use them.

 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.moviepass.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  MoviePass
 </a>
 made waves in 2017 when it introduced a radical — if unsustainable — plan. For $10 a month, you could watch a movie every day at any theater you want. You could even cancel any time you want. It sounded like the perfect deal.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Unfortunately, it was too good to be true. The company paid the same ticket price you would for every ticket, which meant it almost always lost money the first time you went to the theater. This didn’t lend itself to a sustainable business model. Since 2017, MoviePass burned through millions of dollars paying for movie tickets,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/29/business/moviepass-service-outage-finances.html?module=inline" title="">
  briefly shut down a couple times
 </a>
 when it couldn’t pay its bills and was eventually forced to dramatically water down its service just to stay afloat.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">

  delisted from the Nasdaq
 </a>
 . The $7.25 million worth of stock that MoviePass’s own CEO had in 2017 is

  worth about $50 today
 </a>
 . Not $50 million. $50. Not enough to buy six months of MoviePass.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Despite the disaster of MoviePass’s specific business model, imitators have popped up.

 offers a similar plan, but with much more limitations (and thus more sustainability), AMC launched its own subscription
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=amc+alist&amp;oq=amc+alist&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0l6.1996j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  called A-List
 </a>
 that only works within its own theater chain and MoviePass even revamped its own plans to cut its losses.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Arguably, MoviePass’s first mistake with its ill-fated subscription was having few terms to limit its use. It appealed to moviegoers, but was bound to be problematic business-wise: You could watch any movie at any theater any time, all for less than the price of a single ticket at most theaters. Today’s subscriptions are a little more complicated (or expensive), with arcane rules that change their value proposition entirely. With that in mind, let’s go over what each one costs, the limitations of each and who they’re best suited for.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 MoviePass plans change almost too frequently to keep up with. During the process of writing and editing this article, the company overhauled its plans entirely, only three months after
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/31/movies/moviepass-timeline.html?module=inline" title="">
  the last time it overhauled its plans entirely
 </a>
 . In another six months it may change again. For now, you have two options with MoviePass:
</p>
<p class="css-1e7dx92 evys1bk0">
 For $19.95 a month, you can watch up to one 2D movie a day at most major theater chains including AMC, Regal and Cinemark. For a limited time after its introduction, users could sign up for $14.95 a month, but the company gave no indication how long this deal would last or how long that price would be locked in for.
</p><p class="css-1e7dx92 evys1bk0">
 Users can lock in a $9.95 per month rate by paying for the entire year up front. This gets you the same 2D movie per day as the monthly plan, but you save about $120 every year. It should be noted that since first introducing its original
 <!-- -->
 $10 per month
 <!-- -->
 pla
 <!-- -->
 n
 <!-- -->
 in 2017, MoviePass hasn’t gone a straight 12 months without changing its plan, and even users who pay by the year have been affected by changes. The Terms of Service specifically note that MoviePass has the right to change its service at any time.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 These plans come with some serious caveats, though. For starters, you can only sign up for that annual plan price if you hand over your bank account information. Monthly plan users can sign up with a debit or credit card. In the past, MoviePass has made questionable charges that users (or former users)
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://lifehacker.com/make-sure-moviepass-didnt-reactivate-your-subscription-1829491233" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  have had to dispute
 </a>
 . Disputing charges made with your bank account information is possible, but
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.quora.com/What-procedures-are-typically-required-to-reverse-or-repudiate-an-ACH-transaction" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  more difficult
 </a>
 .
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In addition to the above, the plan comes with many restrictions: You can’t watch a movie more than once. If you already used MoviePass to watch the latest Spider-Man movie, you’re going to have to find some other superhero movie to watch next time or pay out of pocket. If you watch too many movies, you might also be cut off. According to the Terms of Service:
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  This means that MoviePass has the right to limit the selection of movies and/or the times of available movies should your individual use adversely impact MoviePass’s system-wide capacity or the availability of the Service for other subscribers.
 </em>
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Additionally, for most theater chains — including the big ones like AMC, Regal and Cinemark — you can’t reserve seats or order online. Instead, you have to be physically at the theater in order to buy a ticket, and you can only buy them on the day you plan to watch the movie. This makes it much harder to plan a movie night ahead of time.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Right off the bat, you have to be a bit of a risk taker to use MoviePass. Its plan sounds remarkably similar to the plan that nearly shut it down in the first place, but there’s no telling when the company will change its plans, or if it will even still be in business a year from now. And paying for the annual plan via bank transfer is especially risky, as it makes it harder to dispute charges and you have to trust MoviePass to secure your banking info properly.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 If you can get over those many hurdles, MoviePass is ideal for users who want to have their choice of theater, and who will see at least two to three movies per month. The
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/about/adjuster.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  average ticket price in the US
 </a>
 in 2018 was $9.14, which is less than even the cheapest version of the MoviePass plan. Depending on your region, MoviePass can be up to $20 for just 2D showings. You’ll rarely break even on just one movie per month, but two would be a start. If you can hit your limit of all three movies, that would be even better. For the cheapest version, you’ll need to see two movies per month, and the most expensive option would need three or more. Of course, the more you watch, the more likely you are to hit that invisible wall that could start to limit your selection.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 By comparison, AMC’s theater subscription plan is much more generous, but slightly more expensive than MoviePass. There’s only one plan, which costs between $19.95 to $23.95 depending on where you live. According to AMC, pricing is $19.95 in 35 states, and only markets where ticket prices are higher than average cost more.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 With the A-List plan, you get the following benefits:
</p>
<p class="css-1e7dx92 evys1bk0">
 You can watch up to three movies per week. There are no restrictions on which specific movies you can watch, though A-List can’t be used on special shows like Fathom Events.
</p><p class="css-1e7dx92 evys1bk0">
 You can choose 2D, 3D, IMAX or Dolby showings for any of your movies. There’s no upcharge for “premium” showings.
</p><p class="css-1e7dx92 evys1bk0">
 You can order ahead and even reserve seats at theaters with assigned seating. There’s no time limit on how far ahead you can order a ticket, though there are limitations on how many reservations you can have at once.
</p><p class="css-1e7dx92 evys1bk0">
 Since A-List is part of the Stubs program, you also get discounts and $5 rewards for every $50 spent. The cost of A-List counts toward that reward, which means a
 <!-- -->
 $20 per mont
 <!-- -->
 h
 <!-- -->
 subscription comes out closer to
 <!-- -->
 $18 per mont
 <!-- -->
 h
 <!-- -->
 .
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 AMC could hypothetically offer up to 156 showings per year. While MoviePass claims you can watch a movie a day, it also offers vague threats to limit users who use it “excessively.” It’s also roughly the same price as MoviePass’s monthly plan, but that includes 3D and IMAX showings. Unfortunately, AMC doesn’t offer a lower price tier if you only care about 2D movies.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 While you potentially get more movies, there’s one peculiar limitation. You can only have three active “reservations” at a time. While you’re allowed to watch three movies per week, you need to have at least one reservation slot open in order to buy a ticket. If you pre-buy tickets for three movies next month, you can’t order an A-List ticket this week unless you cancel one of those reservations. This usually only affects very heavy movie goers, but it can be an inconvenient hurdle if you like to plan ahead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 A-List is for AMC lovers, first and foremost. If you prefer Regal or Cinemark (or don’t live near an AMC theater), then you’re out. On the other hand, if you can handle the chain lock-in, then A-List can be worth it for as little as one movie a month. IMAX, 3D, and Dolby showings are included — and those tickets can get expensive. In some rare cases, a single premium showing can pay for A-List in a month.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 More likely, you’ll need to see at least two or more movies a month to get your money back, and the more the better. Heavy users will be able to get far more than their money’s worth out of it compared to other plans. It’s not unlimited, but it’s the closest thing to it on the market right now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Sinemia has been a quiet competitor to MoviePass for years, but with a much more sustainable (if less appealing) business model. The company offers more options than we have the space to go through, so we’ll focus on just a few.
</p>
<p class="css-1e7dx92 evys1bk0">
 For $7.99 a month (billed annually), you can watch up to three 2D movies every month. There’s no limit on which movies you can watch, and you can even order advance tickets, though the process to do so is complicated. If you don’t use all three of your movies, one can rollover to the next month.
</p><p class="css-1e7dx92 evys1bk0">
 For the $8.99 a month (also billed annually) Plus plan, you can watch up to two movies per month, including 3D and IMAX showings.
</p><p class="css-1e7dx92 evys1bk0">
 For $14.99 a month, you can watch up to 30 2D movies per month. Unlike AMC’s A-List, there’s no weekly limit, so if you want to spend every single day in the theater, you can.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The unlimited monthly plan comes with a $30 initiation fee, which means it might take a while before you break even. The other plans must be billed annually, which means you’re taking a risk that you’ll get the most out of your plans before the year is done.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 If none of those plans fit your needs, Sinemia offers a few more plans in between with various specific details, including only one or two movies a month. The company is also the only one we found that
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.sinemia.com/for-two/new-plans/us/los-angeles?plan_type=3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  offers family plans
 </a>
 that scale up to six people.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 On top of the monthly plans, Sinemia has recently added a $1.80 “processing fee” per movie. This fee has become the subject of
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/class-action-lawsuit-against-moviepass-competitor-sinemia-heating-up-2019-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  a class-action lawsuit from existing users
 </a>
 . Additionally, some users have complained that their accounts have been canceled without warning. While Sinemia claims this is due to fraudulent activity, many users insist that this is not the case.
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.bbb.org/us/ca/west-hollywood/profile/online-retailer/sinemia-inc-1216-883526/complaints" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  An influx of reviews on the Better Business Bureau
 </a>
 have also cited app crashes and unresponsive customer support.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Sinemia used to be more reliable but it’s recently had the same woes as MoviePass. There’s no real quota you’d have to hit to make Sinemia worth it because if you don’t use it enough, you can just drop to a lower tier. One movie a month costs $4. Three movies costs $8. Every plan costs less than the national average for movie ticket prices, so long as you use it.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 However, Sinemia’s annual billing and “membership initiation fee” throws a wrench in the gears. If you pay by the month for the unlimited plan, Sinemia will charge you at least $30 to sign up, which can eat into those savings. You’d have to see almost five movies to break even in the first month. For the cheaper plans, it’s easier to break even, but only if you use the plan throughout the year.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s also hard to overlook the recent warning signs from Sinemia. While the company has operated with minimal controversy for years prior, its recent policy of new fees and closing accounts might make it almost as risky as MoviePass. However, if you like to dive into the details of a plan and make absolutely sure you’re getting the best bang for your buck, Sinemia is probably for you.

 WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. — Fred Rosen, the retired Ticketmaster tycoon, was eating a melted ham-and-brie sandwich at the exclusive

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Yes, what people use to hold up their pants. You can buy one at Walmart for $4, he noted. Or you can get one at Gucci for $1,500. “Every product I can think of has a luxury version, which got me thinking,” Mr. Rosen said. “Why not movies?”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s an idea that has captivated one entrepreneur after another over the years: For a high price, allow tech billionaires, Wall Street titans, professional athletes, Russian oligarchs and other ultra-wealthy people to rent movies — as soon as they come out in theaters — for viewing at home. Think of it like Netflix for one-percenters. But such upstarts have always sputtered, including one backed by Best Buy in 2013 that charged
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/la-xpm-2013-apr-09-la-fi-ct-rich-people-cinema-20130409-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  $500 per movie
 </a>
 on top of $35,000 in setup costs. Film studios, fearful of angering theater chains, have been reluctant to participate. Piracy has also been a concern.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. Rosen, 75, and a septuagenarian golfing buddy, Dan Fellman, who is Hollywood’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/30/business/media/dan-fellman-executive-at-warner-bros-to-leave-studio.html?module=inline" title="">
  foremost film distribution expert
 </a>
 , may have finally figured out how to make it work. They have quietly founded
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.redcarpethomecinema.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Red Carpet Home Cinema
 </a>
 , which rents first-run films for $1,500 to $3,000 each. Red Carpet has contracts with Warner Bros., Paramount, Lionsgate, Annapurna and Disney’s 20th Century Fox and Fox Searchlight divisions — resulting in some 40 movies annually, including blockbusters like “Aquaman” and “A Star Is Born.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Those partnerships reflect entertainment-industry relationships that Mr. Rosen and Mr. Fellman have cultivated over decades. Most studios do not see them as disrupters from Silicon Valley, something that has
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://variety.com/2016/film/news/warner-bros-kevin-tsujihara-screening-room-1201752023/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 </a>
 like
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-sean-parker-20160405-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Screening Room
 </a>
 , which has tried without success since 2016 to speed first-run movies to homes for a premium price. (Sean Parker of Napster and Facebook fame is behind that one.)
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Red Carpet also arrives at a time when the movie industry is undergoing sweeping change — not the least of which involves the manner in which Netflix is
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/16/business/media/netflix-movies-hollywood.html?module=inline" title="">
  challenging the traditional way that films are released
 </a>
 . For the most part, theater owners insist on a three-month period of exclusivity to play new films. Netflix has started to chip away at that practice, offering theaters an exclusive window of three weeks or less for films like “Roma” and “Bird Box.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Most studios see broader distribution change as inevitable, noted Harold L. Vogel, author of the textbook “Entertainment Industry Economics.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Consumers want to have more control,” Mr. Vogel said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Even so, studios are treading carefully. None of the film companies that have signed on as Red Carpet partners would discuss the venture publicly. Several major movie operations, including Universal, Sony Pictures and Disney’s other labels, are Red Carpet holdouts. They also declined to comment.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “I feel pretty comfortable that we can gain more studio partners,” Mr. Rosen said. “We are a niche offering — I’m too old for disruption — but even if a studio makes $25 million to $50 million annually from us, that’s found money.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Theater owners, in the meantime, seem to be taking a wait-and-see approach to Red Carpet.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “I have no take on that,” said Adam Aron, chief executive of AMC Entertainment, the dominant theater chain in the United States. In contrast, Mr. Aron has readily criticized start-ups like MoviePass, the
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/business/media/moviepass-subscription-plan.html?module=inline" title="">
  subscription ticketing service
 </a>
 .
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The folksy Mr. Rosen, who took over Ticketmaster in 1982 and helped
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/12/business/12tickets.html?module=inline" title="">
  turn it into a goliath
 </a>
 , and Mr. Fellman, who started his studio career in 1964, worked out details for Red Carpet over rounds of golf at the well-to-do Hillcrest Country Club in Los Angeles. The luxury service operates a bit like a private club. There is a rigorous application process, and participants must have a credit card with a limit of at least $50,000. Those who become customers must buy a $15,000 box that connects to a home theater system (installed by a technician) and comes loaded with piracy protections.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Prices for rentals are set by the participating studios, with higher fees for blockbuster-style movies like “Shazam!” and lower costs for dramas like “The Shape of Water.” Each rental allows for two viewings in a 36-hour period.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 How big could Red Carpet get? There are more people who can afford it than you might think. Nearly 46,000 Americans have annual income of
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/netcomp.cgi?year=2017" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  more than $2 million
 </a>
 , according to Social Security Administration data from 2017. Mr. Rosen and Mr. Fellman, however, insisted over lunch in mid-March that they were not interested in size.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “We’re not even looking for 10,000 people,” Mr. Rosen said. With fewer than 4,000 customers, Red Carpet could have $300 million in annual revenue, according to Mr. Fellman’s projections.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Red Carpet, which counts Sherry Lansing, the former chief executive of Paramount, as an investor, has been operating in about 25 homes as part of a beta test since December. “I’m recommending the service to my friends,” the Red Carpet website quotes Ms. Lansing as saying.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. Fellman added: “I’m not interested in starting a business that is disruptive to the theatrical experience. Maybe we get 400 homes in New York and L.A. Maybe 100 in each of the 30 biggest cities in the United States.” (Celebrities and Hollywood big shots have long been able to see first-run films in their homes — free — as part of something known as the Bel-Air Circuit. Studios allow a limited number of
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203986604577253852745599184" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  preapproved V.I.P.s
 </a>
 to “borrow” copies of new movies.)
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “We told studios, ‘You set the terms,’” Mr. Fellman said. “They appreciated that. What doesn’t work in Hollywood is going in and wagging a finger and saying, ‘This is how it’s going to be.’”

 I don’t know if you’re the type of person who can’t wait to get out of your clothes as soon as you get in the door from work, but I am.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 I love to peel off too-tight trousers and wriggle free of restrictive blouses and, best of all, escape the double clutch of a bra. Feeling free and looking insane, I wander half-dressed through my apartment on my phone, hunting for snacks. This is the least self-conscious moment of the day, a private ritual that would look funny to anyone watching. Usually, nobody is. Once, though, somebody was. An entire film crew, actually.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And several people were taping, so now I suppose anyone who watches the film will see me struggle out of a woolen skirt, letting it fall to the ground in an unsexy heap. Then they will watch me, in tan-colored control-top pantyhose and a chunky knit turtleneck, lean into the refrigerator looking for one of those yogurts with the candy corners before sitting heavily on an exercise ball and devouring the yogurt as I flick through a gossip magazine.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The film premiered last week, and I got to see it for the first time. Lots of firsts for me that day: first time being in a movie, first lead role, first time seeing my butt up there on the big screen at the same time 300 strangers did.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 That last part was my favorite, which is surprising to me. I’ve never really liked how I look. Please don’t correct me or get mad at me when I tell you that. I appreciate that I’m able-bodied and I get to move around the world with that privilege. I am in awe of the body-positivity movement, but despite huge efforts toward it, when I look in the mirror I’m either ambivalent or full-on

 muttering, “Well, there’s a reliable disappointment.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 I understand there are a hundred reasons for this — societal, systemic, psychological and so on. But I no longer devote energy to figuring them out. I have finite time and resources, so I get on with more important things like understanding the Green New Deal or really getting to know my Instant Pot or, best of all, doing anything and everything I can think of to be funny.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Funniness to me is simultaneously an escape hatch and a way of facing reality. In dark times and in sad places I can still usually find it, at least enough of it to keep me going.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 One muffled fart expertly placed, by me, close to a nun and in front of a class got me through my personal annus horribilis, my 14th year. I traveled to Erbil, Iraq, in 2016 for a comedy workshop, when the Islamic State still controlled a big chunk of the
 <!-- -->
 country
 <!-- -->
 . My peers there taught me that jokes can and must be deployed by those who need them most. I still laugh when I remember a stand-up comic there and a joke he told, in perfectly poor taste, about an unsatisfied wife. We follow each other on Instagram, and the year after we met I watched as he donned his pesh merga uniform and joined the battle to take back Mosul.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The older I get, the less sense the world makes, but thankfully, funny is a renewable resource.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 I imagine that because I’ve nurtured this resource, I got to make this film. I’m still surprised it exists. It has been seven years since my friends, and now my directors, Mike and Enda, first mumbled the idea to me in a Dublin pub. “Wouldn’t it be a gas if you were kind of a lonely driving instructor and you could talk to ghosts?”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And now this very silly supernatural romantic comedy exists. I thought about my friends, who wrote and directed this lonely ghost-talking driving instructor movie, when I watched the comedian Chelsea Peretti

  said
 </a>
 . Why not just write a good role for a woman, she asked the roomful of nervously grinning writers in formal wear. “Is that too kooky? Here’s a simple way to do it if you’re struggling — you know how you like guys? Just imagine you liked women.” The laughter that followed had a wince to it, because of the truth in the joke.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 I’m not claiming to be the first to deliberately set aside self-consciousness in order to focus on the funny. Many women have cast off expectations and inhibitions and gone straight for the laughs.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">

 “Insecure,” the one who makes me laugh out loud with her buoyant silliness and generosity. In Tina Fey’s memoir, “Bossypants,” Ms. Fey
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://slate.com/technology/2011/07/tina-fey-s-bossypants-an-excerpt.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  recalls a time
 </a>
 when Amy Poehler, new to “Saturday Night Live,” was doing a goofy bit in the writers’ room. Jimmy Fallon interrupted her and said: “Stop that! It’s not cute! I don’t like it.” Ms. Fey describes what happened next: “Amy dropped what she was doing, went black in the eyes for a second, and wheeled around on him.” She told him, forcefully, that she didn’t care whether he liked it.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But enough about them; back to me. I’ve been feeling very important because I’m in a movie. Earlier this year, I emailed my agent to ask something:
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  I’m the lead, so I’ll be on the poster, right?
 </em>
 He said he’d check, and then the email trail went cold, which always means the answer is not the one I want. Weeks later, I saw the poster. I’m not on it — there’s just a ghost peeking out of a garbage bin. I laughed a lot when I saw that.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 I take myself too seriously, probably because I’m a human being. With our big brains and our bigger egos, we can’t help building the case to ourselves and others that we are very important creatures, when really we’re ludicrous. To be funny is to remind ourselves again and again just how ridiculous we are.

 The luncheon was pegged to International Women’s Day on March 8 and raised around $500,000 for United Nations programs benefiting at-risk women. But the politesse of the occasion was lost on one man, who bowled over to discuss Ms. Hurd’s role as a villain on “

  The Associated Press
 </span>
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 NEW YORK — Woody Allen breached his four-movie deal with the online giant by making statements about the #MeToo movement that damaged prospects for promoting his films, an Amazon lawyer said Friday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Attorney Robert Klieger told U.S. District Judge Denise Cote that the company protected itself after Allen made "public comments that at a minimum were insensitive to the #MeToo movement."
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The hearing was related to a lawsuit Allen filed in February seeking at least $68 million in damages. The lawsuit said Amazon ended his 2017 contract in June without ever releasing a completed film, "A Rainy Day in New York."
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Allen was not in court. John Quinn, his lawyer, told the judge that Seattle-based Amazon initially claimed it was ending the deal because of allegations made against Allen, not because of his recent statements.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "The baseless allegations against Mr. Allen are decades old," Quinn said. He added that the claims were well known when Amazon signed its deal with Allen in August 2017.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Allen's adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow, said in 1992 that Allen molested her in an attic when she was 7. Allen has repeatedly denied it.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 2014, Farrow wrote about the allegations and then appeared in an interview early last year for the first time.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Quinn said Amazon has since changed its explanation for terminating the contract to blaming Allen for making statements saying that the #MeToo movement should not become a witch hunt.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The lawyer said the company had also cited claims that people in the industry won't work with Allen.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Regardless, Quinn said, Allen planned to produce a new movie this summer.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In court papers, Amazon noted that Allen's son, Ronan Farrow, published an article in The New Yorker just weeks after the company signed its contract with Allen. The article detailed reports of sexual misconduct against movie producer Harvey Weinstein. Weinstein has denied non-consensual sexual conduct occurred.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "The article became the catalyst for a broad reckoning over the persistence of sexual harassment in entertainment and other industries," Amazon's lawyers wrote.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 They said Allen then made a series of public comments "suggesting that he failed to grasp the gravity of the issues or the implications for his own career."
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 They cited several quotes by Allen in a magazine article including: "You don't want it to lead to a witch-hunt atmosphere, a Salem atmosphere, where every guy in an office who winks at a woman is suddenly having to call a lawyer to defend himself."
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 They also noted that after Dylan Farrow recounted her memories of sexual abuse in January 2018, Allen publicly dismissed the statements in a newspaper article as "cynically using" #MeToo for attention.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Klieger told the judge Allen's public comments resulted in controversy "in Hollywood and outside of Hollywood."
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The effect of the comments mean the pictures can no longer be made or promoted, Klieger said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 After hearing both lawyers, the judge set a case schedule stretching into next year.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Allen and possibly Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, among others, were likely to provide depositions unless the case is resolved through private mediation in coming weeks.

 Like “United 93,” “Hotel Mumbai” begins from the uncomfortable premise of turning an actual terrorist incident into material for a dramatized suspense feature. In November 2008, 10 men
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/27/world/asia/27mumbai.html?module=inline" title="">
  unleashed gunfire and grenade assaults across Mumbai
 </a>
 , killing more than 160 people.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The film, inspired by a documentary, “Surviving Mumbai,” relays these events from the vantage points of a sprawling international ensemble. The characters, many of them composites, are the guests and staff members of the Taj Mahal Palace &amp; Tower Hotel, one of two luxury hotels the terrorists targeted, and where more than 30 died during the siege.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 An affluent couple (Nazanin Boniadi and Armie Hammer) leave their newborn upstairs with the nanny (Tilda Cobham-Hervey) to enjoy their dinner date in the hotel restaurant. A high-rolling Russian (Jason Isaacs) plans to spend the evening cavorting with local escorts. The heroic hotel employees include the head chef (Anupam Kher) and a Sikh waiter (Dev Patel) who shows up to work that day without proper footwear but begs to stay, needing the shift.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Anthony Maras, making his first feature, interweaves these threads with precision and clarity, conveying an impressive sense of the hotel layout, the confusion of the circumstances and the visceral fear of hiding from the gunmen. (The opulent hotel was re-created in both Mumbai and Adelaide, Australia.)
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But the more involving “Hotel Mumbai” plays in the moment, the queasier it seems in retrospect. It reduces the randomness of real-life bloodshed to the slick thrills of a popcorn movie. And after the mosque attacks in Christchurch, which

  more than $1.3 billion last year
 </a>
 , became one of the highest-grossing superhero movies of all time. It did that by delivering a wide-screen vision of Black Excellence, where blackness isn’t just about the generational trauma and pain that comes from living under racism. It’s about reckoning with choices made to hold on to one’s culture and the best way to carry it into the future.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Watching it for the first time last year, I felt overjoyed. I tear up when I think of the scene just before T’Challa fights to become king, when Wakandans make their way to Warrior Falls in an elaborate floating procession, an expression of communal love for their history and culture. I have been immersed in the Black Panther universe for years as a comics fan, critic and creator. Yet I still felt, sitting there at the premiere in Los Angeles, that this was the kind of art that I had waited my entire life for.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Superhero fictions tend toward the aspirational, showing humanity in broadly idealized form, and that’s exactly what the director, Ryan Coogler, and his team did with “Black Panther.” Africa, in the film,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/12/magazine/why-black-panther-is-a-defining-moment-for-black-america.html?module=inline" title="">
  is presented as a place where glorious achievement has always happened.
 </a>
 “Black Panther” feels like both a celebration and an investigation of what it means to be part of the global African diaspora.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 After buzzing off that high, I wondered what the next movie capable of speaking to me on that deep level might be. Would it be another sweeping Black Excellence melodrama? A slavery period piece with a fresh perspective? A sci-fi legal drama where a black criminal defense attorney has to represent extraterrestrial refugees? A thriller where assassins target a college basketball phenom organizing a movement to get him and his friends paid?
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The answer turned out to be something completely different:
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/movies/us-movie-review.html?module=inline" title="">
  Jordan Peele’s new movie, “Us,”
 </a>
 which excites me for entirely different reasons. This stylish and utterly terrifying horror film doesn’t makes its black characters into superheroes, because it doesn’t have to. They are normal folks, albeit with one big creepy paranormal problem, and their complete everyday-ness is what makes this film so resonant.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Us” isn’t about institutionalized racism. Its subject is the other tensions that run through the fabric of American life. The family at the center of the film are fighting for their lives, and their fight is a metaphor for the class tensions that periodically explode into ugly factionalism in the United States.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In the film, metaphorical economic stratification turns some human beings into homicidal Others — they’re called Tethers in “Us.” And in a rare turn, the
 <!-- -->
 black people
 <!-- -->
 in the film, the Wilson family, aren’t the other. Adelaide, her husband, Gabe, and their two children occupy the position of the ordinary family who have their lives upended by the unsettling threat. They don’t respond to it with martial prowess or stoic durability, either. They freak the hell out, like any normal people would. Like the Griswolds in the “National Lampoon” movies, the Wilsons are just a family on vacation. The parents grumble and embrace, and the kids bicker, just like my siblings and I did when we went to Disneyworld.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When the Wilsons inevitably come face to face with their evil doppelgängers, “Us” becomes a film about, among other things, unaddressed histories creeping back into your life. If Mr. Peele’s new film can be said to have a moral, it might be about the cost we pay, as individuals and as a society, for wanting to live the good life, which means burying past trauma and refusing to reckon with all of ourselves.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 That the director chooses to rest the prickly heart of his cinematic ambitions in a dark-skinned black woman, Lupita Nyong’o, makes it even more meaningful. Her Adelaide Wilson isn’t a resolute military leader, like Danai Gurira’s General Okoye in “Black Panther.” She’s a nurturing, nervous and neurotic mother, drawn with a nuance and texture that allows viewers to relate to her no matter what walk of life they might come from.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 My euphoria over “Black Panther” last year felt like one answer to a deep yearning to feel connected to African-descended people all over the world and see our shared roots reflected in glory. “Us” giddily fulfills a different, opposite need: a desire to see black life reflected back at life-size scale, not idealized or put on a pedestal. Hey, look, there’s Winston Duke busting out dad jokes, awkwardly having to explain his favorite old songs to his kids and putting some bass in his voice to seem more threatening than he actually really is. I do those things, and so do a lot of my friends.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about what comes after Wakanda, and “Us” points the way to the broader horizons Hollywood should explore. Mr. Peele’s new film presents its black characters the same way it does its white ones. The specific texture of their blackness is still palpable, in the way they talk and react to the world around them, but it doesn’t have to have any special meaning. It’s just part of who they are, and they could be any of the millions of other black people all over the world. In “Us,” the black performers don’t need to be symbols. They can just be, even with boogeypeople chasing them onscreen. For all the horror and mystery in “Us,” this element of charming ordinariness gives me a little bit of hope for the movies coming in a post-“Black Panther” world.

  In my family, we watch a new movie every Friday night. However, my mother always brings out her phone halfway through and reads the ending on Wikipedia. This is not fair for two reasons: I do not have a phone, and it is an insult to the filmmakers and actors.

 My guess is your mom is just trying to understand what is happening in the movie. Your mom and I are not as quick as we used to be, and it is easy to lose the plot as our minds wander to thoughts of the past and death and yearned-for naps. But you’re right that she’s not honoring the spirit of movie night, which is togetherness. Turn the subtitles on — they help! — and put the phone down, Mom! Meanwhile, I can’t order her to give you a phone (nice try), but when you do get one, I encourage you to go into Wikipedia and change the ending of any movie you’re watching, in case she lapses.

 For the 9:20 p.m. movie, Jesse Locascio threaded film through the projector. This was after he had sprayed compressed air on the sprockets and rollers, blowing out dust that could show up as black dots on the screen.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “This is not how they do it at the multiplex,” he said. “Not even close.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Not in the digital age.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. Locascio, 28, is a movie projectionist who can do things the old-fashioned way, operating projectors with big reels of celluloid. Projectionists, he says, are a dying breed and he learned much of what he knows in a long, narrow room of clattering machinery: a projectionist’s booth at the
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://burnsfilmcenter.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Jacob Burns Film Center
 </a>
 in Pleasantville, N.Y.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Jacob Burns, as it is known, operates a media arts lab that teaches digital literacy as well as a nonprofit art house that was screening
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066563/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Where’s Poppa?”
 </a>
 — a 1970 comedy directed by Carl Reiner — at 9:20 in theater two. But it also trains projectionists, and in an art house, that means learning to handle more than digital files.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It means learning to handle celluloid.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “It was a whole new education,” said Jesse Modica, who as the center’s technical director is Mr. Locascio’s boss. Mr. Modica had worked in commercial theaters before he arrived at the Jacob Burns in 2007.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “My previous training didn’t include any of the nuances,” he said, but he learned from the projectionists at the Jacob Burns. And now Mr. Modica trains newcomers like Mr. Locascio in the mechanics of showing film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Training a projectionist is “like giving somebody private lessons,” Mr. Modica said. “A lot of this is muscle memory. Once I teach someone, ‘O.K., this is how you inspect the film, this is how you get the sound to work, this is how you make sure you’ve got the right aspect ratio,’ they’ve got to remember come showtime. It’s like someone taking karate. You can learn all the karate you want in the dojo, but are you going to remember when you’re being attacked in an alley?”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Jacob Burns has five theaters. It can show digital films in all of them and celluloid in three. Even then the newest of the projectors are almost antiques. Mr. Modica said they are only 10 years old, but the company that made them has gone out of business.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The projectors running “Where’s Poppa?” are older: They were originally used at Lincoln Center, Mr. Modica said, and probably date to the 1970s.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 For generations, movie theaters had two projectors for each screen. The movies were cut into segments, each about 20 minutes long and each on a separate reel. Every 20 minutes, as the end of one reel approached, the projectionist had to start the next reel on the other projector.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 There was a reason for the two-projector arrangement: the bulb in the projector had a life span of not much longer than 20 minutes. The projectionist had to install a new bulb every time he — and most projectionists were men in those days — changed a reel. Longer-lasting bulbs were perfected in the 1960s and 1970s, and with them reel-like platters big enough for a whole movie to fit on just one.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 That changed the labor equation. Projectionists became what Mr. Modica calls “a niche trade.” In the 1940s, there were more than 30,000 projectionists nationwide and 2,400 in New York City, but with the rise of television in the 1950s, “the number declined as more Americans chose to stay home and watch TV,” the labor economists Robert D. Atkinson and John Wu wrote in 2017 in a
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://itif.org/publications/2017/05/08/false-alarmism-technological-disruption-and-us-labor-market-1850-2015" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 By 2015, there were fewer than 5,000 nationally. “There’s a supply shortage,” said Douglas McLaren, the manager of Cornell Cinema, the campus film exhibition program at Cornell University. “There are not enough jobs. Also, film exhibition now is becoming a rarefied thing, so the old-school projection mentality, when the profession employed thousands of people and film prints were expendable, is gone. There’s been a need to step up the quality of work that projectionists do.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 That has happened as film has all but disappeared from most theaters. Most large chain theaters “have zero film,” said Tal Marks, a former chief projectionist at the Museum of Modern Art who is now the museum’s audiovisual technical manager. “The mainstream moviegoing audience is not seeing film anymore. The blockbuster hits are digital representations.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And in most multiplexes, the theater managers run the projectors, which is how Mr. Modica got his start, at a chain-owned theater in Bronxville, N.Y.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He began as a 16-year-old usher in 1995, the year “Toy Story,” “Die Hard With a Vengeance” and “Apollo 13” came out.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The first time he went into the projection booth and saw the film going into the projector, “I was in awe, I was scared, I didn’t want to touch it, I didn’t want to be responsible for anything going wrong.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The theater manager doubled as the projectionist. Mr. Modica learned the basics of projection after he was promoted to assistant manager at another theater in the chain a couple of years later.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. Locascio also started as an usher when he was a teenager and went on to study filmmaking at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan. After he graduated in 2012, the Jacob Burns hired him as a projectionist, offering on-the-job training, even though he had learned about film editing at S.V.A.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “I do feel it’s a dying field, the film end of things,” Mr. Locascio said. Still, he added, “with digital, you still need someone there for quality control, making sure the volume is right, the brightness is right.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When he is not behind the projectors at the Jacob Burns, he works on film crews as a focus puller, responsible for keeping the camera focused when the director yells “Action.” He has worked on the Netflix movie “White Girl,” the documentary “The Hunting Ground,” and the teen horror film “The Ranger.” The Jacob Burns schedules him as a projectionist three or four times a week.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Movies like “Where’s Poppa?” are sent by a film archive and are treated with care. “They’re not being mass produced anymore,” Mr. Modica said. “We can’t say, ‘Hey distributor, give me another reel,’ because there isn’t another reel.” When a movie arrives from an archive, “We have to sign a release saying we will return this print in the condition it arrived in and if anything is wrong we accept responsibility. That puts a lot of pressure on.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Is digital less stressful?
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Yes and no, Mr. Modica said. “In the celluloid world,” he said, “a good projectionist could fix any technical or mechanical malfunction on the fly within minutes.” Digital projection is moving a projectionist’s duties “toward an IT job instead of a mechanical job.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “The way these things work now, if there’s corrupt software, a projectionist can’t fix that in a few minutes,” he said. There are calls to a service desk somewhere. “If rebooting your server to your projector doesn’t fix whatever problem you’re having, you’re down” until a technician can come.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 At 9:20, Mr. Locascio flipped a toggle switch marked “projector motor.” The clicking started. On the screen, the credits rolled.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In the booth, there was no time to follow the plot or laugh at the sight gags. Mr. Modica moved a digital projector out of the way so that he could reach the other reel-to-reel projector, and loaded the second reel of “Where’s Poppa?” On the screen, George Segal was taking a shower and shaving.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 A few minutes later, a man in a gorilla suit was terrorizing Ruth Gordon, but Mr. Locascio did not notice. He was concerned about something else.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “When is the next show?” he asked.

 “Got porn, Madam?” That’s what the high school boy known variously as Milk Carton and Egg Muffin asks a DVD store clerk after some stammering feints in the Tamil movie “Super Deluxe.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, yes, Madam has porn. But, surprise: When Egg Muffin and his pals start to watch it, one of them becomes enraged. That’s his mother onscreen.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This sets off a chain of mostly comic events that are, by turns, ominous, bloody and cosmic. And that’s just one plot strand. In another, a married woman’s ex-boyfriend dies in her bed, setting off a chain of comic, ominous events. In a third, a little boy pines for his father to return, and the father does — but now transformed into a woman. (Another chain ensues.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The director Thiagarajan Kumararaja, who also had a hand in the script, takes his time setting all these shaggy, laconic story lines in motion. Part of the movie’s pleasure in its early going is figuring out whether and how they will all merge.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Another pleasure is visual. Colors pop off Kumararaja’s palette (the cinematographers are P.S. Vinod and Nirav Shah), and there’s always something to look at in his Chennai. This isn’t gleaming, ascendant India; it’s the lived in one, crumbling around the edges, a little romanticized but recognizable in its narrow alleys and concrete stairwells and power outages.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Super Deluxe,” Kumararaja’s second feature, has been a while in coming after “Aaranya Kaandam” (2010), which was a critic’s darling. No wonder — Kumararaja’s work is stylish and wry, with an indie-cinephile sensibility. (It’s no accident that “Kill Bill” and
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/gangs-of-wasseypur-2015" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Gangs of Wasseypur”
 </a>
 posters hang on the DVD store’s wall.)
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Part of that sensibility is a frankness about sex that’s still unusual in Indian movies, especially commercial ones. Though nothing explicit is shown, all the story lines in “Super Deluxe” have a little sexual motor, and there’s plenty of frank, off-color language, too.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Kumararaja also elicits some wonderfully deadpan performances from his actors. The teenage boys have a believably nerdy-raffish rapport And Samantha Akkineni, as the cheating wife, builds a character of unexpected depths.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Super Deluxe,” though, runs three hours, and Kumararaja loses his way in the draggy, overlong second act. It includes not one, but two drawn-out scenes of threatened rape. (We know the ugly outcome of one, though it happens off camera.)
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 That these scenes, with their leering Bollywood-ish villain, verge on the cartoonish doesn’t save them. They’re part of a tonal problem — what was mostly delicate and offbeat tips into something cruder and messier. They also serve as a reminder: Cinematic sexual liberation for (and by) men can be punishing for women.

 It’s clear why filmmakers can’t resist the allure of Alfred Hitchcock even if they inevitably fall short of him. But his imitators rarely come up with movies as pointless as “Naples in Veils,” which tips its hat vigorously toward the master’s motifs — the lost-and-found doubling of “Vertigo,” the repressed trauma of “Marnie,” possibly even Salvador Dalí’s eye design from “Spellbound” — only to wind up as a tedious muddle.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Adriana (Giovanna Mezzogiorno), a pathologist in Naples who is shy with men, has a one-night stand with Andrea (Alessandro Borghi), a much younger diver. The sex is rendered with a level of detail that seems more suited to a Euro-art remake of “Fifty Shades of Grey” than a Hitchcock riff — but then again, it’s supposed to become an obsession for Adriana. They make plans to meet at a museum the next day, except Andrea doesn’t show up.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or rather, he has shown up dead in a nearby dumpster, something Adriana learns soon after starting an autopsy on his corpse. But then she spots him, alive, in a subway station. And in her garden. And did we mention that her mother apparently went crazy?
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Promising ideas are in place; even using as a backdrop a city as rich in history and steeped in Catholicism as Naples might have appealed to Hitch. But the director, Ferzan Ozpetek, hasn’t found a way to bring his borrowed themes together with style, momentum or suspense. Visually and musically, “Naples in Veils” does little to conjure a sensation of passion or delirium. All that’s left, in this case, is a self-nullifying plot.

 ROME, Ga. — A Georgia man who has acted in zombie movies is accused of beating two women and forcing one of them to taste his blood.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Rome News-Tribune reports 30-year-old Eliot Ryan Rutledge faces charges including false imprisonment and aggravated assault.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rutledge allegedly trapped a woman inside his home in Rome, Georgia, in August 2018 and assaulted her by punching, elbowing and poking her. Floyd County Jail documents report the same woman was assaulted at his home between June 2017 and October 2018.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He's also accused of hurting another woman in January by choking and biting her and forcing his cut hand into her mouth to make her taste his blood.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 IMDB.com credits Rutledge with producing and acting in the 2017 short films "Gangsters and Zombies" and "Gangsters and Zombies II."

 Setting a stage musical inside a stalled subway car sounds like such a natural idea that I’m surprised there hasn’t been a whole bunch of such shows. But after watching the film adaptation of
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.backstage.com/magazine/article/ny-review-stuck-52074/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  the 2012 musical
 </a>
 “Stuck,” directed by Michael Berry, I’m sorry anybody ever thought of the concept at all.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Everyone has a story like yours within them,” sings the sagacious homeless man Lloyd (Giancarlo Esposito, who, like most of the cast, somehow manages to get through this with his dignity intact). The stories of the five other passengers on the stationary subway car aim to show how, yes, we’re all connected and yes, we all need one another.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The pregnant woman (Ashanti) who intends to terminate her pregnancy needs to hear from the grieving mother (Amy Madigan) who lost her adult son to cancer. The sullen dancer (Arden Cho) needs to learn that the floppy-haired guy who seems to have been stalking her, to the point of following her onto this very car (Gerard Canonico), is not a stalker as such, but a sensitive artist.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And so on. Underneath the ostensible humanism of the scenarios, fleshed out in songs by the playwright Riley Thomas with Tim Young and Ben Maughan, seems to lurk a mind-set more attuned to “Father Knows Best” than “Rent.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When the characters are singing, you can’t wait for them to get back to talking. And when they’re talking, you can’t wait for them to get back to singing. After a while, you start wishing you were watching that TV ad with a bunch of people on a bus, singing about how they have a structured settlement but they need cash now. That spot gets its point across in less time, and has better music.
