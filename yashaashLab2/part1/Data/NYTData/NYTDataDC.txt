 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.

 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/movies/captain-marvel.html?module=inline" title="">

  Billy Batson
 </a>
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Noh-Varr_(Earth-200080)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/brie-larson-wants-ms-marvel-to-show-up-in-captain-marvel-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing

  “The Umbrella Academy”

 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">

 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.

 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

  Billy Batson
 </a>
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Noh-Varr_(Earth-200080)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/brie-larson-wants-ms-marvel-to-show-up-in-captain-marvel-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s

</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.

 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

  Billy Batson
 </a>
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Noh-Varr_(Earth-200080)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/brie-larson-wants-ms-marvel-to-show-up-in-captain-marvel-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">

 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience

  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Lucas Rodriguez had a goal and an assist and D.C. United scored three times within a nine-minute span to beat the Colorado Rapids 3-2 on Saturday night.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Luciano Acosta tied it at 1 in the 35th minute with a left-footed rocket into the roof on the net.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Chris Durkin gave United (4-1-2) the lead three minutes later, finishing Rodriguez's pass from a narrow angle. It was the 19-year-old's first professional goal.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Kei Kamara scored on a header in the 66th minute to cut it to 3-2. Benny Feilhaber gave the Rapids (0-5-2) the lead in the 11th minute with a shot from the left side of the 6-yard box.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  </em>
 </strong>
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

 cake

 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.

 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/brie-larson-wants-ms-marvel-to-show-up-in-captain-marvel-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">

 </strong>
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

 cake

 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.

 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

  Billy Batson

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">

 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

  Nor-Varr

 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">

 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.

For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.

 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.

 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

  Nor-Varr

 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th.

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006.

She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.

 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil).

When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing

 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)

 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience

  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

  Tim Burton’s “Batman

 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

  Billy Batson

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.

 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/movies/captain-marvel.html?module=inline" title="">

  Billy Batson
 </a>
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Noh-Varr_(Earth-200080)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/brie-larson-wants-ms-marvel-to-show-up-in-captain-marvel-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing

 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values

 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.

 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

  Billy Batson
 </a>
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Noh-Varr_(Earth-200080)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/brie-larson-wants-ms-marvel-to-show-up-in-captain-marvel-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s

</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.

 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

  Billy Batson
 </a>
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Noh-Varr_(Earth-200080)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/brie-larson-wants-ms-marvel-to-show-up-in-captain-marvel-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">

 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience

  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Lucas Rodriguez had a goal and an assist and D.C. United scored three times within a nine-minute span to beat the Colorado Rapids 3-2 on Saturday night.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Luciano Acosta tied it at 1 in the 35th minute with a left-footed rocket into the roof on the net.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Chris Durkin gave United (4-1-2) the lead three minutes later, finishing Rodriguez's pass from a narrow angle. It was the 19-year-old's first professional goal.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Kei Kamara scored on a header in the 66th minute to cut it to 3-2. Benny Feilhaber gave the Rapids (0-5-2) the lead in the 11th minute with a shot from the left side of the 6-yard box.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  </em>
 </strong>
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

 cake

 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.

 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/brie-larson-wants-ms-marvel-to-show-up-in-captain-marvel-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">

 </strong>
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

 cake

 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.

 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

  Billy Batson

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">

 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

  Nor-Varr

 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">

 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.

For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">

  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/movies/captain-marvel.html?module=inline" title="">

  Billy Batson
 </a>
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Noh-Varr_(Earth-200080)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/brie-larson-wants-ms-marvel-to-show-up-in-captain-marvel-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing

 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values

 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

  Billy Batson
 </a>
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.

 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

  Mar-Vell

 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.

She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.

 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”

 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”

 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">

 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience

  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

  Billy Batson
 </a>
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Noh-Varr_(Earth-200080)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/brie-larson-wants-ms-marvel-to-show-up-in-captain-marvel-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">

 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience

  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”

 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">

  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

  Billy Batson
 </a>
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Noh-Varr_(Earth-200080)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing

 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”

 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience

  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006.

 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”

 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”

 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">

 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience

  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

  Billy Batson
 </a>
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Noh-Varr_(Earth-200080)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/brie-larson-wants-ms-marvel-to-show-up-in-captain-marvel-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">

 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.

For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”

 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”

 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">

 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.

  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience

  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”

 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing

 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing

  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">

 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience

  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more.

 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

  Billy Batson
 </a>
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Noh-Varr_(Earth-200080)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.

 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

  Billy Batson
 </a>
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Noh-Varr_(Earth-200080)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/brie-larson-wants-ms-marvel-to-show-up-in-captain-marvel-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s

</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.

 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

  Billy Batson
 </a>
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Noh-Varr_(Earth-200080)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/brie-larson-wants-ms-marvel-to-show-up-in-captain-marvel-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.

 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

  Billy Batson
 </a>
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Noh-Varr_(Earth-200080)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/brie-larson-wants-ms-marvel-to-show-up-in-captain-marvel-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">

 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Lucas Rodriguez had a goal and an assist and D.C. United scored three times within a nine-minute span to beat the Colorado Rapids 3-2 on Saturday night.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.

 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  </em>
 </strong>
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

 cake

 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.

 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

  Billy Batson
 </a>
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/brie-larson-wants-ms-marvel-to-show-up-in-captain-marvel-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.

 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  </em>
 </strong>
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

 cake

 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

  Billy Batson

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

  Nor-Varr

 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">

 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

  Billy Batson

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.

For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)

 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience

  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience

  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>

 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing

  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

  Tim Burton’s “Batman

 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

  Billy Batson
 </a>
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Noh-Varr_(Earth-200080)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/brie-larson-wants-ms-marvel-to-show-up-in-captain-marvel-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.

 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/movies/captain-marvel.html?module=inline" title="">

  Billy Batson
 </a>
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Noh-Varr_(Earth-200080)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/brie-larson-wants-ms-marvel-to-show-up-in-captain-marvel-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing

  “The Umbrella Academy”

 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">

 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.

 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

  Billy Batson
 </a>
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Noh-Varr_(Earth-200080)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/brie-larson-wants-ms-marvel-to-show-up-in-captain-marvel-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s

</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.

 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

  Billy Batson
 </a>
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Noh-Varr_(Earth-200080)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/brie-larson-wants-ms-marvel-to-show-up-in-captain-marvel-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">

 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience

  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Lucas Rodriguez had a goal and an assist and D.C. United scored three times within a nine-minute span to beat the Colorado Rapids 3-2 on Saturday night.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Luciano Acosta tied it at 1 in the 35th minute with a left-footed rocket into the roof on the net.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Chris Durkin gave United (4-1-2) the lead three minutes later, finishing Rodriguez's pass from a narrow angle. It was the 19-year-old's first professional goal.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Kei Kamara scored on a header in the 66th minute to cut it to 3-2. Benny Feilhaber gave the Rapids (0-5-2) the lead in the 11th minute with a shot from the left side of the 6-yard box.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  </em>
 </strong>
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

 cake

 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.

 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.

 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.

 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.

 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

  Nor-Varr

 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

  she said.

</p><p class="css-1e7dx92 evys1bk0">
 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">

 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience

  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more.

 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

  Billy Batson
 </a>
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Noh-Varr_(Earth-200080)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/brie-larson-wants-ms-marvel-to-show-up-in-captain-marvel-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">

 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

  Billy Batson

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”

 When her series began in 2014,

  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience

  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

 </a>
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Noh-Varr_(Earth-200080)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/brie-larson-wants-ms-marvel-to-show-up-in-captain-marvel-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">

 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”

 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">

 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">

 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

  Billy Batson
 </a>
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Noh-Varr_(Earth-200080)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>

 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">

 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience

  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">

 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience

  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

  Billy Batson
 </a>
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Noh-Varr_(Earth-200080)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/brie-larson-wants-ms-marvel-to-show-up-in-captain-marvel-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">

 </strong>
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

 cake

 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.

 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints.

Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">

 </strong>
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

 cake

 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">

 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.

For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said

Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

  Nor-Varr

 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">

 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience

  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)

 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience

  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>

 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing

  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

  Tim Burton’s “Batman

 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

  Billy Batson
 </a>
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Noh-Varr_(Earth-200080)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/brie-larson-wants-ms-marvel-to-show-up-in-captain-marvel-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.

 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/movies/captain-marvel.html?module=inline" title="">

  Billy Batson
 </a>
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Noh-Varr_(Earth-200080)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/brie-larson-wants-ms-marvel-to-show-up-in-captain-marvel-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing

  “The Umbrella Academy”

 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">

 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.

 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

  Billy Batson
 </a>
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Noh-Varr_(Earth-200080)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/brie-larson-wants-ms-marvel-to-show-up-in-captain-marvel-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s

</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.

 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

  Billy Batson
 </a>
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Noh-Varr_(Earth-200080)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/brie-larson-wants-ms-marvel-to-show-up-in-captain-marvel-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">

 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience

  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Lucas Rodriguez had a goal and an assist and D.C. United scored three times within a nine-minute span to beat the Colorado Rapids 3-2 on Saturday night.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Luciano Acosta tied it at 1 in the 35th minute with a left-footed rocket into the roof on the net.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Chris Durkin gave United (4-1-2) the lead three minutes later, finishing Rodriguez's pass from a narrow angle. It was the 19-year-old's first professional goal.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Kei Kamara scored on a header in the 66th minute to cut it to 3-2. Benny Feilhaber gave the Rapids (0-5-2) the lead in the 11th minute with a shot from the left side of the 6-yard box.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  </em>
 </strong>
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

 cake

 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.

 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/brie-larson-wants-ms-marvel-to-show-up-in-captain-marvel-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">

 </strong>
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion

 cake

 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.

 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

  Billy Batson

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

  she said.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">

 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He also lost his job with the Wizards.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for

 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

  Nor-Varr

 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 </a>
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDFxQgB3OQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Doom Patrol,”
 </a>
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/television/review-black-lightning-is-pulp-with-a-purpose.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 </a>
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/review-legion-season-2-fx.html?module=inline" title="">
  (“Legion” on FX)
 </a>
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and
 </em>
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/books/20comi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Way has generously cited
 </a>
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,

 </a>
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hulu.com/series/nicky-ricky-dicky-dawn-31ab6b70-efb6-44f4-b147-3803f0eb9a3c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.

 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.

One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days.
