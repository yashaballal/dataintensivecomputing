 NEW YORK — Seven films in, the DC Extended Universe is finally flying with some wind behind its back. The well-reviewed, more modestly budgeted "Shazam!" debuted with $53.5 million over the weekend.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "Shazam!" has collected an estimated $56.8 million in total, including about $3 million from early advance screenings. Made for about $100 million, "Shazam!" follows recent DC successes such as "Aquaman" and "Wonder Woman."
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Paramount Pictures' "Pet Sematary" remake opened in second with $25 million. It's a decent start for the Stephen King adaptation, though far from the haul that the last big-screen adaptation of King's conjured up. "It" opened with $123.4 million in 2017.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Last week's top film, "Dumbo," slid to third with $18.2 million.

 DC Comics’s latest superhero spectacle,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/movies/shazam-review.html?module=inline" title="">
  “Shazam!
 </a>
 ,” which opens this weekend, follows the comedic adventures of Billy Batson (Asher Angel), a teenage boy who transforms into an adult superhero called Shazam (Zachary Levi). A buff, lightning-bolt-emblazoned man-boy, Shazam isn’t as well-known now as he used to be. But he is one of the most important heroes in comic history.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Shazam first appeared in Whiz Comics No. 2 in 1939, quickly becoming one of the most popular comic book characters of the 1940s. In his prime, he regularly outsold Superman and Batman. And he was the first comic book superhero to appear on film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Back then, however, he went by the name Captain Marvel, which is a bit confusing, particularly given the debut of Marvel’s “
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/movies/captain-marvel-review.html?module=inline" title="">
  Captain Marvel

 ” last month. That may also help explain why Shazam feels a bit unfamiliar today.

</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Early box office predictions indicate that may be changing. Still, who is this guy? And what’s with the Captain Marvel thing? Here’s a primer on Shazam’s history.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1939, Fawcett Comics was looking to capitalize on the superhero boom created by characters like Superman. The writer Bill Parker came up with the idea of a team of superheroes, each of whom possessed the power of a different mythological figure. The idea was ultimately revised to just one character with all of those powers, and thus was born Shazam.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Parker originally called him Captain Thunder, but that name was already trademarked, so he switched to Captain Marvel. (A competitor, Timely Comics, did not rebrand as Marvel Comics until 1961.) The artist C.C. Beck was the illustrator, and he continued to draw Captain Marvel throughout the 1940s.

</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In his first appearance, Billy is an orphaned paperboy who meets a wizard in a mysterious subway station. After learning about Billy’s sad life, the wizard declares that he is too old to keep fighting crime and asks Billy to take his place. He endows Billy with the power to turn into Captain Marvel any time he says the word “Shazam,” which is an acronym for the “immortal elders” who give him his powers: Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles and Mercury.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The fact that Captain Marvel was secretly a kid made him a favorite among young readers. “Whiz Comics” No. 2 sold 500,000 copies, and the character’s own series, “Captain Marvel Adventures,” first came out in 1941, the same year he made his big screen debut.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 That film debut, in March 1941, was the 12-part live-action Republic Pictures serial “Adventures of Captain Marvel.” It is considered the first comic book superhero film, and it beat the first animated Superman cartoons to the big screen by six months.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In that version, Billy is a young explorer on an expedition to Siam, where he encounters the wizard. As Captain Marvel, he is tasked with protecting the world from the Golden Scorpion, an ancient and dangerous device sought by scientists and criminals. “Adventures of Captain Marvel” feels somewhat primitive and surprisingly violent by today’s superhero standards (Captain Marvel kills a lot of people), but it’s worth viewing to see how far the genre has come.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1951, National Comics Publications successfully argued that Captain Marvel was a copyright infringement on Superman because of their similar powers, costumes and artwork, signaling an end to a legal battle that began a decade earlier. (National had even tried to block the release of “Adventures of Captain Marvel.”) Fawcett paid National $400,000 in damages and was forced to cancel all of its superhero publications. No new Captain Marvel comics were produced for the next 22 years.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1972, DC Comics acquired the rights to Fawcett’s characters and began producing new Captain Marvel stories the next year. Marvel Comics, however, had meanwhile trademarked the name,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/movies/captain-marvel-history.html?module=inline" title="">
  creating its own Captain Marvel in 1967
 </a>
 . DC was permitted to call its superhero Captain Marvel, but it was not allowed to use the name on any marketing or titles featuring the character. DC decided to sell its Captain Marvel books under the title “Shazam!”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 A children’s television series based on DC’s Captain Marvel, titled “Shazam!,” debuted on CBS in 1974. In the series, Billy (Michael Gray) travels around the country in a motor home with an adult companion (Les Tremayne) solving problems each week by turning into Captain Marvel (played by Jackson Bostwick and later John Davey). The show had a very low budget, so Captain Marvel appeared only very briefly in each episode.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show lasted three seasons. A short-lived animated series featuring Captain Marvel, called “The Kid Super Power Hour With Shazam!” followed in 1981, and lasted 12 episodes, but that was his last starring role for a while.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Through the 1980s and ’90s, DC further integrated Captain Marvel into its comic universe, giving the character appearances in “Justice League,” “Kingdom Come” and his own continuing series, “The Power of Shazam!,” which lasted from 1995 to 1999. He returned to television in a 2005 episode of “Justice League Unlimited.” Playing on the fraught history between Captain Marvel and Superman, the character is introduced as a big fan of Superman, but the two heroes eventually come to blows.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The episode includes a fun Easter egg for comic book fans, as Captain Marvel’s hometown is named Fawcett City after his original publisher. Captain Marvel also makes several appearances in the Cartoon Network series “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and in several of DC’s direct-to-video animated films.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 2011, DC Comics relaunched all its comics with the New 52 initiative. New 52 was an attempt to simplify decades of complicated comic book history, and Captain Marvel received an updated origin story by the writer Geoff Johns, along with an official name change to Shazam.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The new “Shazam!” film incorporates multiple elements of the back story introduced by Johns. In 2018, DC debuted a new “Shazam!” comic book, the character’s first continuing series in nearly 20 years. Shazam may never again overtake Superman in popularity, but the box office and critical success of the new film should ensure that a whole new generation will know his name.

 LOS ANGELES — Warner Bros. has finally earned back the benefit of the doubt when it comes to its all-important superhero movies: “Shazam!” became the studio’s third nonsequel comic-book hit in a row over the weekend, arriving to

 “We really want these movies to stand on their own, with filmmakers best suited to the characters,” Toby Emmerich, chairman of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group, said by phone on Sunday morning. “We’re all feeling deservedly really good.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Shazam!” was the No. 1 movie in North America, collecting $53.5 million over the weekend, according to Comscore, which compiles box-office data.

 Second place at the domestic box office went to a remake of “Pet Sematary” (Paramount), based on the novel by Stephen King. It took in an estimated $25 million. Disney’s big-budget “Dumbo” trundled along in third place, selling $18.2 million in tickets, for a sad two-week total of $76.3 million.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Shazam!” was made by New Line, a division of Warner that focuses on lower-cost films that often serve as counterprogramming. Made for about $100 million — about 40 percent less than most superhero movies — “Shazam!” tells the story of a teenage boy (played by Asher Angel, known for Disney Channel’s “

 ”) who can turn himself into a hero with an adult body (Zachary Levi) and unique powers.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “New Line always thought that ‘Big’ as a superhero movie was a great idea, a way to make the genre feel fresh and different,” Emmerich said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Warner has spent the better part of a decade trying to get its act together with movies based on characters from its DC Comics division — an imperative given the runaway success of rival Marvel Studios and the film industry’s increasing need for spectacles that audiences see as worth a trip to theaters. Part of the problem was that Warner stuck for too long with a dark vision for its superhero universe, set by the filmmaker Zack Snyder, that was
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://variety.com/2017/film/news/dc-films-justice-league-1202632214/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  clearly not working
 </a>
 . That led to creative and financial messes like “Suicide Squad” and “Justice League.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But the studio, having largely jettisoned Snyder’s plans and shaken up its executive ranks, including

  promoting Emmerich
 </a>
 , has started to deliver superhero home runs on a consistent basis: “Wonder Woman” from Patty Jenkins, “Aquaman” from James Wan, and seemingly “Shazam!,” which was directed by a relative newcomer, David F. Sandberg.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Where the PG-13 “Shazam!” will end up at the box office remains a bit of a question mark given the impending arrival of “Avengers: Endgame.” Ticket buyers gave “Shazam!” an A grade in CinemaScore exit polls, an indication of staying power.

 Two superheroes, both alike in not taking themselves too seriously, had very different experiences at the box office this weekend.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Warner Bros.’s “Shazam!” made $25.1 million domestically, a solid sum that kept it in first place after a strong debut last weekend.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 That PG-13 film centers on a teenager (Asher Angel) who can transform into a hero with an adult body (Zachary Levi) by speaking the word “shazam.” Based on a DC Comics character, "Shazam!” has a jaunty and lighthearted tone, and its continued box-office success provides further evidence of the

</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Shazam!” picked up an additional $35.9 million outside of North America this weekend, according to Warner Bros., which brings the film’s worldwide gross to $258.8 million. That’s more than double the roughly $100 million the movie cost to make.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But a mix of wisecracks and superpowers is no guarantee of success, as evidenced by another new movie: Lionsgate’s “Hellboy,” financed by Millennium Media.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 That film, a bloody, R-rated affair with a cherry-red, semi-demonic superhero (David Harbour) at its helm, landed in third place with a dreary $12 million in North American theaters this weekend, well below analysts’ expectations. A reboot of the

 Jason Winn burst into Chameleon Comics &amp; Cards looking like Superman stumbling upon kryptonite.

 “What is going on?” Mr. Winn said to the regulars in the shop who had already read the handwritten sign outside.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Their glum faces told the story: Chameleon was shutting its doors after nearly 30 years in Manhattan’s Financial District.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “This shop was like home to me,” said Mr. Winn, a paralegal, who works nearby and had grown used to his steady fix of Chameleon’s eclectic selection of comic books, graphic novels, baseball cards and action figures. “These kind of comic shops are shutting down left and right.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Beyond the shop’s merchandise, the scene was what really attracted a steady cadre of regulars, from scruffy comic junkies in search of bargains to well-dressed Wall Streeters looking to drop serious money on the store’s impressive selection of collectible baseball cards.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 They all shared a common despondency during the shop’s last week before it closed on March 31. And they came together one last time to lament the demise of their favorite gathering spot, a place where you could land bargains while discussing the latest releases with like-minded collectors.

 The store’s owner, Steve Wu, 50, said business had been declining for years and that he could no longer afford to stay open now that his lease was ending and his landlord was raising the rent significantly.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. Wu would not disclose the exact amount, but said the increase would put his rent well over $10,000 per month for the 500-square-foot shop on Maiden Lane just east of Broadway.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Business, he said, never quite rebounded after the Sept. 11 terrorist attack occurred several blocks away. Also, he added, younger people do not seem to collect comics like older generations did.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The shop is one of many small service-style businesses that caters to the work force that fills the area on weekdays. Inside, it was hardly a charming space — sparsely decorated with worn beige tiles underfoot and large fluorescent lights overhead, along with a large inflatable Spiderman doll hanging from the ceiling.
</p>

 “We became part of the community — a lot of people came here just to hang out and get away from work,” said Mr. Wu, as he hugged some of his customers. “But with a store like this, the profit margin is very low. It’s not like a Chanel store where you can make a few sales a day.”

 When new comic books arrive in stores on April 17, retailers who ordered the latest issue of a Buffy comic will get a bonus: free copies of Issue No. 0 of Angel, a new series.

 “We wanted to do something special with the launch of Angel,” Arune Singh, the vice president of marketing for

 . The first three pages of the issue present a different perspective on the final moments of Buffy No. 4, which arrives in stores the same day. In the Buffy comic, one of the characters is in a dire predicament, which is silently observed by Angel. In his comic, Angel sees the struggle, but readers are clued into his brooding on past sins and a cycle of violence. “I might be powerless to break it,” he thinks, “but who would I be if I didn’t try?”

 Boom! is giving retailers around the country some of the 29,000 copies of Angel No. 0, which has a cover price of $3.99, based on the number of copies of Buffy No. 3 (from March) that they ordered. Additionally, Angel No. 0 will not be available for download until May 1, making the need to visit a comic store more immediate.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “We want these comic shop retailers, who are the lifeblood of this industry, to know we are committed to them,” Singh said.

   NEW YORK CITY

  is known around the world for the big stuff — iconic guidebook attractions like the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty. But New Yorkers know that the city’s essence lies in the smaller, neighborhood places that make up its unique fabric.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If not well known, they are certainly well loved: the local dive bar or diner; the quirky Laundromat; the tiny shoe repair shop. And while the city is always in transition, the change these days seems relentless. Beloved spots are succumbing to high rents and are often replaced by chain businesses.

 In November 2017, the stand-up comic Nacho Redondo told a joke at a university about the Paralympics that upset some audience members and drew controversy online, which he promptly used to promote his next shows. It may sound like a common, even mundane story.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But in Venezuela, where Redondo, 32, developed a following for his brash, dark humor, the price for a joke that offends can be much higher than online outrage or a boycott. After politicians harshly criticized him on state-run television, Redondo received death threats online, and the government sued him. He fled the country on the day the lawsuit was filed, and hasn’t returned. “I was terrified and then paranoid and scared for my life,” Redondo said by Skype from Mexico City, where he now lives, adding that he didn’t want to leave his aging mother and other family members but felt he had no choice. “You get jailed there because of tweets.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 American comics often complain about the chilling effect of political correctness and social media mobs. Or about the damage done when the Trump administration targets

 </a>
 or “Saturday Night Live.” But in an era of rising authoritarianism around the globe, the threat to comedians in countries without a tradition of freedom of speech can be much more severe.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In the fascinating series “Larry Charles’ Dangerous World of Comedy,” which debuted in February, Charles, the director of “Borat,” visited comics in some of the most repressive countries in the world, including Somalia and Iraq. “Comedians have been murdered in broad daylight in both countries,” Charles said by phone. Then he added, referring to Ahmed Albasheer: “The Jon Stewart of Iraq, who I profile in the show, can’t do his show anymore because he would be killed.” A Saudi Arabian comic has been jailed since he talked to Charles.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 With platforms like Netflix increasing their presence around the world, the policies of regimes that crack down on comedy are not as remote as they once were. When Hasan Minhaj criticized the Saudi regime on his show “Patriot Act,” that government asked Netflix to take the episode down in that country. The streaming service agreed, saying it needed to
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.npr.org/2019/01/01/681469011/netflix-drops-hasan-minhaj-episode-in-saudi-arabia-at-governments-request" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “comply with local law.”
 </a>
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In Venezuela, a country in economic and political turmoil, laboring under national blackouts and punishing economic sanctions, President Nicolás Maduro has aggressively targeted comedy for years. Using the same broadly defined law that it employed to sue Redondo, the
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-donkey/venezuelan-firemen-face-trial-for-donkey-video-mocking-maduro-rights-groups-idUSKCN1LW0RU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  government arrested two firefighters
 </a>
 for posting video online poking fun at Maduro.
</p>

 Mayda Hocevar, the director of the human rights observatory of the
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.uladdhh.org.ve/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 </a>
 , said many comics have been forced out of the country because the government, as she put it in an email, “has been criminalizing satire.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The most significant comic to leave Venezuela might be Luis Chataing, who was the popular host (4.7 million Twitter followers) of a “Daily Show”-like program. The show was taken off the air in 2014, the day after he made fun of the government. Chataing said the government pressured the TV station by threatening other companies it owns. Maduro
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/venezuelas-president-denies-involvement-in-canceling-tv-show-critical-of-him-1402698768" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  denied playing any role
 </a>
 , but when Chataing, who now lives in Miami and broadcasts
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzl_kA-4vNMaJ4v9vsVU4yw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  online,
 </a>
 took his show on a live tour, he helped radicalize a large segment of the fairly young standup scene.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Before 2014, comedians in Venezuela steered clear of political content because they didn’t want to alienate their fan base,” said Emiliana Duarte, a writer and editor for the website
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.caracaschronicles.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Caracas Chronicles
 </a>
 . “But when Maduro clamped down on dissent, that’s when comedy became more confrontational.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Redondo said comedy in Venezuela has become a rebellion. “The radio station I worked at, we had a meeting where they said you can’t use Maduro’s name. So comedians did the opposite onstage,” he said. “That was the only place no one can regulate you.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Redondo, who grew up a fan of the HBO specials of Chris Rock and Katt Williams, has used the lawsuit against him to promote a new show that sold out in Miami last year, and is planning a tour of the United States this year where he will refer to the controversy over his Paralympics joke. The title of his show, translated from Spanish, is “Disabled.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He is an unlikely champion for comedy as a tool of dissent; his material normally steers clear of politics and makes light of dark subjects like cancer. Redondo said he became a target when he started commenting on protests and the government on the radio and online. To him, the lawsuit was merely a pretext. “They don’t care about disabled people,” he said, adding in an email: “The ‘disabled joke’ facade was the perfect way to hide the fact that I was targeted just for being influential with young people.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Duarte, the Caracas Chronicles writer and editor, said that far from being the standard-bearer for freedom of speech, Redondo was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. “His joke happened right in a tense, inflammatory moment when over 130 people were killed in protests,” she said. “He was made an example of.” The message was, she said, “Look what were doing to him. Stay quiet or it might happen to you, too.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In fact, Redondo thought the controversy over the joke — a long bit in which he imagines a 100-meter race between people with different disabilities including a man with one leg, a man with no limbs and a communist — might blow over. But then he was attacked on the television show of
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/world/americas/venezuela-us-sanctions.html?module=inline" title="">
  Diosdado Cabello,
 </a>
 the politician widely viewed as the second-most powerful person in Venezuela.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “If Cabello calls you on the show,” Redondo said, “it’s a sign: Go after him. If he pronounces your name, you have to leave, basically.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Charles said he began his series with the question of whether comedy could survive governments like that in Venezuela. He came away convinced of the ultimate resilience of the art form. “Laughter is as important as breathing, eating and sleeping,” he said. “Comedy will survive if humanity does.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 There’s no better example than a weekly bar show in Caracas that had been canceled twice because of the blackouts that have crippled the country. The loss of electricity did not stop comedians from putting on a
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/elteatrobar?lang=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  standup show on March 30,

 albeit one without light. It was called “No Nos Vamos a Rendir” — we will not give up.

 went onstage with a microphone, joking that the state’s ideology had defeated him “because I’m talking into a microphone like it’s working,” he said, to a big laugh.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Speaking by phone last week, Ruíz recalled, “Every joke worked because people wanted to laugh.” He added, “They
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">

 to laugh. They’re suffering and just want to get back to normal and so do I. People called it a show of resistance, but I just want to tell jokes.”

 March was a big month for Jordan Peele, the Academy Award-winning writer and director behind “Get Out.” It began with the opening of his second feature, the

 of “The Twilight Zone.” Peele has long idolized that groundbreaking Rod Serling sci-fi anthology series. (The premise of “Us” — about a family besieged by bloodthirsty doppelgängers — was inspired by the episode “Mirror Image.”) The show premieres with two episodes; the first stars Kumail Nanjiani as a fame-seeking comedian, and the second features Adam Scott as a paranoid airline passenger.

 Sam Rockwell narrates this documentary about Hart Island, a 101-acre cemetery for about 1 million New Yorkers who never received a proper burial. The Department of Corrections owns the site, which is closed to the public, and pays prison inmates 50 cents an hour to bury the dead. Several families recount how their loved ones wound up there, and their stories are devastating. Glenn Kenny named the movie a Critic’s Pick in his review in The

Wittier and infused with a sweeter disposition than the average big-screen comic book adaptation — though still plenty violent — del Toro’s movie casts Ron Perlman (“Sons of Anarchy”) as the title character, a demon with a devil tail whose origins involve both Grigori Rasputin and an interdimensional portal built by Nazis. (It’s complicated.) He winds up working for a government agency (secret, naturally) that defends against paranormal threats.

 Jason Mitchell plays the odd man out on a nightmarish retreat to the Catskills in this comedy-drama. What was supposed to be an innocuous birthday party for a friend of a friend turns into something more sinister, thanks in part to the fact that the flock of partyers are young white men whose drunk antics do little to help Tyler (who is black) feel like anything other than an outsider. Michael Cera arrives late in the movie, as a rich kid with a Trump piñata.

 Arcade clients claw way to success.
 <span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
 </span>
</p>
<p class="css-1yxmrkv evys1bk0">
 Rows of toy claw machines can be seen at shopping malls, cinemas and subway stations in China’s big cities. Young people surround the machines, some playing them in groups and others alone.
</p>
<p class="css-1yxmrkv evys1bk0">
 These machines originated from candy dispensers, which appeared in Western countries early in the 20th century and evolved over the decades. They emerged in Japan in the 1980s and were introduced to the Chinese mainland in the 1990s after proving popular in Taiwan.
</p>
<p class="css-1yxmrkv evys1bk0">
 It is estimated that there are 30,000 such machines in shopping malls that opened in China in 2017, with a market value of more than 9 million yuan ($1.3 million).
</p>
<p class="css-1yxmrkv evys1bk0">
 In Japan, the claw machine market size reached 11 billion yuan in 2016, with about 150,000 machines, according to Li Yingshi, an analyst from the Qianzhan Industry Research Institute in Shenzhen, Guangdong province.
</p>
<p class="css-1yxmrkv evys1bk0">
 The items they contain now include sneakers, cakes and snacks. “Japan’s claw machines have become a new form of offline retail,” she said.
</p>
<p class="css-1yxmrkv evys1bk0">
 In China, the machines have become popular with young people playing them in arcades with their friends.
</p>
<p class="css-1yxmrkv evys1bk0">
 Chen Yantong opened a toy claw machine arcade in downtown Beijing with friends in May last year.
</p>
<p class="css-1yxmrkv evys1bk0">
 “When you hang out with friends, you want to do something interesting in addition to dining. As many Chinese are used to buying clothes online, shopping is no longer a priority to kill time. So what should they do with that extra time?” he asked.
</p>
<p class="css-1yxmrkv evys1bk0">
 At the store he helped launch, the peak period is 2 p.m. to 7 p.m. “Competition is fierce, and similar shops are emerging,” Chen said.
</p>
<p class="css-1yxmrkv evys1bk0">
 Liang Suya, 28, a photographer from Qingyuan city, Guangdong province, about 37 miles from Guangzhou, the provincial capital, said: “Many take it for granted that this is just a simple arcade game, but it requires various skills. I enjoy both the soft toys and the process of grabbing them.
</p>
<p class="css-1yxmrkv evys1bk0">
 “It’s a game that requires careful thinking. You make a judgment after careful observation and consideration, including how the dolls are arranged in the machine. I’m really pleased when I figure out an unexpected way to grab a toy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1yxmrkv evys1bk0">
 Liang became interested in playing the machines when she accidentally grabbed a toy duck that she liked. It took her a while to become adept, and her record is successfully grabbing eight toys in 10 attempts.
</p>
<p class="css-1yxmrkv evys1bk0">
 “While a mobile game provides virtual prizes, playing claw machines offers rewards in a more substantial form. It feels different,” she said.
</p>
<p class="css-1yxmrkv evys1bk0">
 Her friend once posted an online video of her grabbing toys, which became a hit, resulting in more than 12 mainstream media outlets interviewing Liang. In January last year, a short video about Liang’s story on the sharing website Pear Video attracted more than 30 million hits and 33,000 comments.
</p>
<p class="css-1yxmrkv evys1bk0">
 She attributes the claw machine fad in recent years partially to the popularity of video sites, where players share their successes and skills with others.
</p>
<p class="css-1yxmrkv evys1bk0">
 “People living in small cities have fewer entertainment choices than those in metropolises. Novelties such as claw machines are appealing to young people, especially those who are on a date and who want to have fun,” she said.
</p>
<p class="css-1yxmrkv evys1bk0">
 Wen Ji’er, 22, a writer who has published several books, plays the machines up to three times a week, each session lasting more than two hours. She gets to learn about the latest trends and gossip from her fellow players.
</p>
<p class="css-1yxmrkv evys1bk0">
 “It’s like a cafe. We’re close to each other and can hear others chatting,” she said.
</p>
<p class="css-1yxmrkv evys1bk0">
 She once arranged to meet a friend and the friend’s partner in a claw machine arcade. Wen believed the couple could get to know each other better by using the machines－for example, whether the young man would be angry if he could not grab a toy.
</p>
<p class="css-1yxmrkv evys1bk0">
 She said playing the machines is a way to relieve her stress. “I don’t like to go to karaoke lounges, pubs or do sports. I like to be by myself and often stay at home in my spare time,” Wen said.
</p>
<p class="css-1yxmrkv evys1bk0">
 “I’ve loved soft toys since I was a child. It (playing toy claw machines) has turned out to be an efficient way for me to deal with anxiety and pressure.”
</p>
<p class="css-1yxmrkv evys1bk0">
 “You need to be extremely focused to grab a doll by using a claw machine. It’s a mixture of excitement and relaxation, and I like the feeling.”
</p>
<p class="css-1yxmrkv evys1bk0">
 Charges for playing the machines in Beijing range from 2 to 5 yuan (30 to 75 cents) for each attempt.
</p>
<p class="css-1yxmrkv evys1bk0">
 Li, the analyst, said they are often installed at shopping malls, cinemas and subway stations－places where there are large numbers of people and high demand.
</p>
<p class="css-1yxmrkv evys1bk0">
 “Many in the industry in China are individuals operating on a shoestring. Most stuffed toys are rather ordinary, and only a few are authorized by big companies, making them more expensive,” she said.
</p>
<p class="css-1yxmrkv evys1bk0">
 Chen, who opened a toy claw machine arcade in Beijing, said consumers like dolls they are familiar with, such as those based on emojis.
</p>
<p class="css-1yxmrkv evys1bk0">
 “It’s a good marketing strategy that they can only get the dolls from claw machines. Young people’s consumption power should not be neglected,” he said.
</p>
<p class="css-1yxmrkv evys1bk0">
 Wang Biao, founder and CEO of the company 12 Block Culture, is inspired by the Japanese market and wants to see a successful model in China.
</p>
<p class="css-1yxmrkv evys1bk0">
 “In Tokyo, some copyright stuffed dolls from popular comics are available only from claw machines. I hope the machines will become a major retail channel for products related to comics and animations in China,” he said.
</p>
<p class="css-1yxmrkv evys1bk0">
 Liang, the photographer, takes a large shopping bag to carry home the toys she wins. She plays the machines once a week and pays 1 yuan for every attempt. She records her expenses and the number of toys she grabs in a notebook. In the past two years, she has spent more than 40,000 yuan on grabbing over 10,000 toys.
</p>
<p class="css-1yxmrkv evys1bk0">
 “Some people don’t understand why we spend a fortune on claw machines, and some even think it’s squandering money,” she said.
</p>
<p class="css-1yxmrkv evys1bk0">
 “In fact, many are willing to spend a lot of money on something they love. Some people may choose to fly to another city to watch a soccer game, or buy a luxury-brand handbag. Playing a claw machine is no different to this.”

 NEW YORK — A rush of newcomers couldn't shake "Shazam!" from the top spot, as the superhero comedy led the box office for the second straight weekend with $25.1 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Lionsgate's "Hellboy" reboot, the animated Laika Studios release "Missing Link," the college romance "After" and even the long-delayed "Mary Magdalene," originally to be released by the Weinstein Co., all opened in theaters. But the strongest new release of them all was, predictably, the Will Packer-produced one: "Little."
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The body-swap comedy "Little" came in second with $15.5 million for Universal Pictures. Made for just $20 million, "Little" is just the most recent profit-maker for Packer, the "Girls Trip" producer.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The film, directed by Tina Gordon Chism, stars 14-year-old Marsai Martin as the child an abusive tech executive (Regina Hall) reverts to after a magical spell is cast on her. Martin, the "black-ish" star, also executive produced the film, the youngest ever so credited in Hollywood history.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "Little" drew a largely female (65 and African American (43%) audience. Jim Orr, Universal Pictures distribution chief, credited the cast, Chism's direction and Packer's overall know-how.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "He's done it with different kinds of films. 'Breaking In' was a thriller, 'Girls Trip' was an R-rated comedy. 'Little' is kind of an all-ages film, PG-13 rated,'" said Orr, whose studio signed a first-look deal with Packer in 2013. "He's a brand. And he has a great idea of what is going to be successful at the box office."
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was an out-of-body weekend at the box office. The body-swap comic-book adaptation "Shazam!" — about a teenage boy (Asher Angel) who can turn into an adult-sized superhero (Zachary Levi) with a simple command — held solidly in its second week. Capitalizing on good reviews and word-of-mouth, "Shazam!" is Warner Bros.' New Line's latest DC Comics success. It has grossed $94.9 million through Sunday with a worldwide total of $258.8 million.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Lionsgate and Millennium's "Hellboy" had been expected by many to vie with "Shazam!" on the weekend. But on the heels of terrible reviews (just 15% "fresh" on Rotten Tomatoes), it flopped with $12 million against a $50 million budget.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 That's significantly less than the debuts of the 2004 original ($23 million opening) and the 2008 sequel ($34.5 million opening). Those films were directed by Guillermo de Toro and starred Ron Perlman; the new "Hellboy" stars David Harbour ("Stranger Things") and is directed by Neil Marshall.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "Missing Link" also missed. It opened with a disappointing $5.8 million, marking a new low for Laika, the maker of eccentric animated tales such as "Coraline," ''ParaNorman" and "Kubo and the Two Strings." ''Missing Link," distributed by United Artists Releasing, is about the discovery of a creature in the Pacific Northwest. Its voice cast includes Zach Galifianakis, Hugh Jackman and Zoe Saldana.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Expectations had varied widely for Aviron Pictures' "After," an adaption of Anna Todd's 2014 best-seller. The young-adult drama fared well with $6.2 million in 2,138 theatres.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And "Mary Magdalene," starring Rooney Mara as Mary and Joaquin Phoenix as Jesus, finally opened, more than three years after production. Harvey Weinstein had once conceived of the film, directed by Garth Davis ("Lion") as his next Oscar contender.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 After the fallout of Weinstein and the bankruptcy of the Weinstein Co., IFC Films acquired the biblical biopic. Critics dismissed it (44% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and audiences mostly did, too. It grossed about $62,000 on 62 screens.

</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Sam is 33 years old, unemployed and counting down the days to eviction from his apartment near the Los Angeles reservoir that gives “Under the Silver Lake” its name. He doesn’t seem too upset about his situation, though he is kind of a mopey guy. His malaise looks like more of a temperamental or existential condition than the response to a crisis. And he doesn’t have it all that bad.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 There are a few guys who are willing to hang out with him, one woman who is willing to have sex with him and a few more who might be, including a neighbor named Sarah with a fluffy little dog. There’s another neighbor who has a lot of birds and walks around topless on her porch, giving Sam an opportunity for a bit of voyeurism and the director, David Robert Mitchell, a chance to nod to
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kCcZCMYw38" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Rear Window.”
 </a>
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This is one of a great many nods, winks, rib-pokes, throat-clearings and other gestures in the direction of famous and less-famous movies, comic books, video games and songs. At one point, an issue of Spider-Man attaches itself to Sam’s hand by means of an errant wad of bubble gum, which is a funny coincidence — no coincidence at all, in other words — because Sam is played by Andrew Garfield, who used to be Spidey.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Most of the other allusions in this shaggy-dog tale of wild conspiracism and male petulance are not quite so blatantly meta. Sam and the director are both steeped in classic Hollywood, ’90s indie rock, and various kinds of vintage memorabilia. The mood borrows from Hitchcock (whose grave figures in one scene), and also from Nicholas Ray, David Lynch, and the Southern California noir tradition more generally. Also Thomas Pynchon, Robert Altman and Raymond Chandler. These aren’t esoteric references yielding themselves up to a connoisseur’s prying. They are part of the movie’s surface, and part of its point.

 . He finds hidden messages in comics, song lyrics and antique cereal boxes, and he connects this information with strange happenings around him.

</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Don’t worry. It doesn’t turn out to matter much. The sweet smarts of Mitchell’s first movie, “

 </a>
 (treated to a bit of auto-allusion in “Silver Lake”) aren’t much in evidence here. Nor are the slippery psychosexual scares of
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/13/movies/review-in-it-follows-a-shape-shifting-horror-stalks-a-teenager.html?module=inline" title="">
  “It Follows,”
 </a>
 his breakthrough horror movie from 2015. The ambitions this time are grander, but also vaguer and duller.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which isn’t to say that “Under the Silver Lake” is without some diverting qualities. The light, for one thing. Mitchell and his director of photography, Mike Gioulakis, savor the gorgeousness that has seduced so many previous filmmakers. And there are some moments of humor and surprise embedded in the overwrought intricacies and long slack stretches of the plot. But beyond the coy nostalgia and the timid satire is a feeling of bottomless exhaustion.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 At a crypt party in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery, in the company of a balloon girl (identified as Balloon Girl in the credits and played by Grace Van Patten), Sam jumps to his feet to dance to
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWkMhCLkVOg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “What’s the Frequency, Kenneth?”
 </a>
 by R.E.M. It’s a song partly about the latent, mysterious meanings embedded in pop ephemera (“I’d studied your cartoons, radio, music, TV, movies, magazines”), and as such a plausible anthem for Sam’s quest.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 An equally apt, less pretentious choice might have been
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jB_QM73Slk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  ZZ Top’s “Tush,”
 </a>
 since that’s mostly what Sam is looking for and the camera is looking at. One of Sam’s prized possessions is an issue of Playboy from 1970 (it belonged to his dad), and “Under the Silver Lake” dwells in a hedged, half-guilty, self-conscious iteration of the magazine’s hedonist philosophy. There’s plenty of titillation and sexual opportunity, but no real lust, passion or liberatory energy.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Even Sam’s sense of belatedness feels secondhand. He’s a Gen-X sensibility trapped in a millennial body, with the tastes and obsessions to match. (Mitchell, it’s worth pointing out, is 44 years old). R.E.M. called irony “the shackles of youth,” and he drags it around like a Styrofoam ball and chain. Like other guys his age, Sam feels oppressed by an older generation of guys who lay claim to all the credit, the money, the art and the women, while he is left with a literal and spiritual pile of junk that may not mean what he hoped it would. The movie turns his resentment into a cosmic joke.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Look, I’ve been there. But I can’t say I sympathize, because there’s no basis for sympathy. “Under the Silver Lake” is less a cinematic folly than a category mistake, taking the sterility of its own imaginative conceits for a metaphysical condition. It isn’t a critique of aesthetic or romantic ennui, but an example of intellectual timidity. As a Los Angeles movie it lacks the rough, naturalistic edge of “La La Land,” and it thinks it’s so much cooler than “La La Land.”

 At the “Captain Marvel” premiere in Los Angeles last month, Brie Larson
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBpsHfN-Ty0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  roamed the red carpet
 </a>
 in a sequined Rodarte slip dress, a galaxy of diamonds cradling her ears. A squadron of F-16 fighter jets flew overhead as fans cheered the movie’s star as she climbed steps to a stage where she was interviewed by Lorraine Cink.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ms. Cink, a self-described comic book geek and red carpet host, did not ask Ms. Larson about her gown as others did that day. Nor did she discuss
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://time.com/5403533/brie-larson-captain-marvel-smile/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  the movie’s internet trolls

  call for more diversity
 </a>
 in Hollywood. Instead she focused solely on Captain Marvel and her alter ego Carol Danvers, a United States Air Force pilot, played by Ms. Larson.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Carol changed my life and this movie hasn’t even come out yet,” Ms. Larson said, as she held back tears.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Red carpet interviews from the premiere were
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8reT9_rMmI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  streamed live for fans
 </a>
 who could not attend. And the show was as slickly produced as any pre-awards festivities, albeit one that edged toward camp at times. (For starters, Ms. Cink’s co-host
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.marvel.com/watch/digital-series/marvel-live/goose-the-cat-gets-ready-for-the-captain-marvel-red-carpet" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 , one of
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/movies/captain-marvel-goose.html?module=inline" title="">
  several that played Goose
 </a>
 in the movie.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ms. Cink is an employee of Marvel Studios, which produced Captain Marvel. And if there is any question why the studio would air the red carpet live, consider this: The live stream has been watched more than 485,000 times on YouTube alone.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Fans today clamor for anything related to their favorite movies and television franchises. As a result, live-streaming from the red carpet is not just for the Oscars anymore. More studios are producing their own red carpet extravaganzas, hiring battalions of brand-friendly hosts to market the studio’s offerings and control social media messaging. And with technology that makes live-steaming easy, new players have joined the fray to take advantage of the summer blockbuster season and its worldwide audience.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Movie premieres have become global moments,” said Doug Neil, Universal Pictures executive vice president for digital marketing. “Fans like to feel like they are part of the experience.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. Neil would know. Last year the studio held only one premiere in London for “Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again.” With an army of Academy Award winners on the red carpet — including Meryl Streep, Colin Firth, Tom Hanks and Cher — the event would be difficult for Universal to reproduce elsewhere, he said. Premieres are expensive, too, sometimes costing $100,000 or more. So
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.facebook.com/MammaMiaMovie/videos/10155481261222665/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  the festivities in London were live-streamed
 </a>
 on Facebook, where they were viewed more than 451,000 times around the world.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “The talent bench was so deep,” Mr. Neil said of the celebrities who attended. “And Facebook has our largest community of fans.” With streaming technology, he added, “It’s very easy to flip a switch.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The quality, though, can depend on whose hand is on the switch. “When we started doing this, it was iPhones on tripods,” said Alison Hoffman, chief marketing officer for the cable channel Starz. Now, she said, the company teams up with media outlets, like Entertainment Weekly, People and Entertainment Tonight, to host live stream red carpet events. That was the case last June at the premiere of “Power” at Radio City Music Hall in Manhattan. The channel
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.facebook.com/Power.Starz/videos/1953785251341056/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  broadcast a live stream
 </a>
 with three video cameras.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “For the right show, it’s a critical part of the mix,” Ms. Hoffman said.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 That is not always the case, though. Last week, the cast of “Game of Thrones” gathered at Radio City Music Hall for the final red carpet premiere for the beloved HBO show. The spectacle was
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDecnF7kR2I" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  broadcast live
 </a>
 by NowThis, a social media content company, which streamed unscripted, raw footage from the “Game of Thrones” press line. An HBO executive said the company was neither involved in nor aware of the live stream, which explains why it had none of the polish of a typical HBO affair.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Photographers could be heard booing when Sophie Turner, who plays Sansa Stark, invited Joe Jonas, her pop star fiancé, to join her on the red carpet. “How about a kiss?” a man shouted at Lisa Bonet, the wife of Jason Momoa, who delighted as the he-man Khal Drogo in Season 1. Ms. Bonet shook her head no; her husband was visibly annoyed.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The video itself was sketchy, too. The camera shook and the Wi-Fi was unreliable. Gwendoline Christie looked fetching in a flowing yellow gown until she waved her silken sleeves and the screen disappeared into a haze of pixelated squares. Still, the live stream has been watched more than 188,000 times on YouTube.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “It’s not always the best quality that gets the most eyeballs,” said Tina Exarhos, the chief content officer of NowThis. “When you are on a red carpet, these are the moments you look for.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Despite the video’s raw quality, she added, “We are looking to do more and more of these with studios.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Walt Disney Studios, which oversees Lucasfilm, Marvel Studios, Pixar and its own slate of movies, has the most sophisticated live-streaming operation in Hollywood. Lylle Breier, who oversees premieres and special events for the studio, said there were often multiple hosts — some on stages, others on the red carpet — and several cameras used for interviews.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The movies that attract the most attention are the “Star Wars” and Marvel franchises. Last April’s red carpet premiere for “Avengers: Infinity War,” for example,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=5208&amp;v=gbRijjvIeyk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  has been watched 7.28 million times
 </a>
 . There, Gwyneth Paltrow plugged her company, Goop. (“She did a Goop detox and she’s fine,” she said of her stressed-out character, Pepper Potts.) Ms. Paltrow also admitted to never having watched an “Avengers” movie.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 As many as 30 people are hired to produce a live-streamed red carpet show for a Disney company premiere. And hosts, like Ms. Cink, have jobs mostly because they are fans. “They do not ask reporter-type questions,” Ms. Breier said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ms. Cink has hosted at least six streaming red carpet premieres and writes all her own questions. She copped to being flustered by only one celebrity: Stan Lee, the force behind Marvel Comics. (Mr. Lee
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/obituaries/stan-lee-dead.html?module=inline" title="">
  died in November
 </a>
 , and “Captain Marvel” carries a dedication to him, as well as a montage of his movie cameos in the Marvel logo.)
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Her background in improvisational theater is helpful, she said. Once her earpiece quit working during a live shot, which made it impossible to hear.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “I looked like a deer in the headlights,” she said. “I screamed my intro. I know I looked, like, cuckoo bananas. And it was completely live. I was kicking off the whole show.”

 A man’s voice recites lines from a poem as fantastical low-resolution images of cityscapes are projected on a screen in a darkened room. “When I couldn’t sleep/I learned to write,” we hear him say. “I learned to write/what might be read/on nights like this/by one like me.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The lines come from Leonard Cohen’s “The Only Poem,” and the visuals, by Jon Rafman, are a collection of processed found photos and landscapes from video games that take the words somewhere far away and transform Cohen’s crisp verse into the narration of a dream.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This piece can be found in “Leonard Cohen: A Crack in Everything,” an exhibition celebrating the life and work of the singer-songwriter,

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The lines from “The Only Poem” speak to the almost mystical bond between those who create art and those who consume it. When a transmission like the one described in the poem happens in pop music, particularly fertile ground for intense longing of all kinds, we might hear a fan say, “That song saved my life.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This emotional identification is, to varying degrees, the
 <!-- -->
 animating
 <!-- -->
 force behind four current museum shows that center on music, including “A Crack in Everything” and exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Arts and Design and the Museum of Sex. Each has something to say about how pop music fits into our lives, how we absorb its history, what it means to present the pop experience in an institutional setting, and how people use music to find themselves.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 At the Met, “Play It Loud: Instruments of Rock &amp; Roll,” which opened Monday, seeks to enrich what you already know, telling a familiar narrative through objects that seem like stars in their own right. Presented in collaboration with the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, “Play It Loud” offers a vision of history in which the rock music that flowered in the 1960s and ’70s sits firmly at the center.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The format of the rock band provides the structure of the show, with one room given over to the rhythm section (here we see a double bass from the low-end legend
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/06/obituaries/james-jamerson-dies-at-45-bassist-backed-detroit-stars.html?module=inline" title="">

 , whose playing provides the rhythmic drive for dozens of Motown hits, as well as drum kits from the Beatles and Metallica) and another showcasing “Guitar Gods,” featuring instruments from Eric Clapton, Jerry Garcia and many more. Another room has a display highlighting the guitar’s destruction, with pieces of instruments trashed by Kurt Cobain and Pete Townshend.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 To the extent that it shifts focus toward the tools of the rock trade, the show is illuminating. Of particular interest is the room set aside for “Creating a Sound,” which focuses on the sonic possibility of electronics and includes beautiful objects like the first Moog modular synthesizer owned by Keith Emerson of the progressive rock band Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Emerson’s instrument is a towering monolith with patch cords hanging off it like an automaton’s viscera, and it highlights how the story of popular music is bound to technology. The Moog presents itself as a roadie’s worst nightmare — it’s almost impossible to imagine a crew packing up a machine of such complexity and loading it onto a truck for the next show.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The lighting in “Play It Loud” is dim, perhaps reflecting rock music as the sound of the night. Each individual instrument shines like a beacon, as if it’s catching the glint of an onstage spotlight. It makes the space between audience member and musician seem vast, but that doesn’t diminish the wonder of browsing the tools once used by pop royalty.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 One of the defining principles of punk,
 <!-- -->
 in contrast,
 <!-- -->
 is that this gap should be much narrower. “Too Fast to Live, Too Young to Die: Punk Graphics, 1976-1986,” which opened Tuesday at the Museum of Arts and Design, adheres to this stricture. The presentation, curated by Andrew Blauvelt, director of the Cranbrook Art Museum in Michigan, is modest, befitting the humble beginnings of the images on display, and the show offers a fascinating look at how punk and new wave music met the eye.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Many of the objects on display in “Too Fast to Live” were first hung in record stores or in the bedrooms of teenagers. Posters promoting new albums, tours and shows are mixed in with album art, zines, buttons and other miscellany. Most of the pieces are affixed to the walls with magnets and are not framed, and almost all show signs of wear. The presentation reinforces that this was commercial art meant for wide consumption, and the ragged edges and prominent creases in the works make the history feel alive.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 That enduringly ragged aesthetic extends to the design itself. Punk as an idea has never left the conversation and retains its aura of cool. Peter Saville’s iconic image for Joy Division’s “Unknown Pleasures” album, for example, seen here in a promotional poster, could just as easily be found on the T-shirt of a current high school student.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Early on, punk’s cheap, trash-culture aesthetic bumped up against the art world, and the mix of high and low makes “Too Fast to Live” a rich show. One room focuses on the influence of comics, as seen in posters for the Angry Samoans and the Damned, while large and beautiful Stiff Records tour posters, designed by Barney Bubbles, bring to mind Warhol’s screen prints.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But while the range of style and aesthetics on display is striking, almost everything here was created for a specific commercial purpose, and directed squarely at those who loved (and might one day love) these bands. The display of buttons that once decorated book bags and jean jackets drives this home. “Too Fast to Live” ultimately feels like a celebration of record culture and fandom. Through these objects, most of which were very inexpensive, a subset of music fans defined themselves as part of a tribe.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Museum of Sex has a show that comes at punk from another angle, illustrating the visceral core lurking beneath these iconic images. “Punk Lust: Raw Provocation 1971-1985” essays a secret history of this music, one based on the presentation of desire.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In the exhibition, which opened in the fall, chain-link fencing surrounds mannequins adorned with fetish gear, and between that and the rivet-studded steel floors, you feel like you’re inside one of the trash-strewn early 1980s downtown New York clubs on display in films like Slava Tsukerman’s “Liquid Sky”
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
 </em>
 or Martin Scorsese’s “After Hours.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 As music movements go, punk rock, which, at its extremes, can be nihilistic or politically didactic, isn’t necessarily associated with sex. But “Punk Lust” suggests that carnal energy throbs at the music’s core.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show begins with imagery from the Velvet Underground: the 1963 paperback of that title, an exploration of what was then called deviant sexual behavior and gave the band its name, is one of the first objects on display. Working through photos, album art and fliers by artists like Iggy Pop, the New York Dolls, Patti Smith, and, yes, the Sex Pistols, the exhibition demonstrates how punk offered a space for sexual expression outside the mainstream.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In the story told by “Punk Lust,” much of it laid out in placards by the writer and musician Vivien Goldman, one of the show’s curators, graphic sexual imagery is a tool for shock that frightens away the straight world and offers comfort to those who remain inside. While some of the power dynamic is typical — underage groupies cavorting with rock stars — images from female, queer and nonbinary artists like Jayne County and the Slits make a strong case for sex as an essential source of punk liberation.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 That sexual expression in music can encompass both crude pornographic fliers created by Adam Ant, which are on display in “Punk Lust,” and also the cool and elegant sensuality coursing through the work of Cohen, says something about how vast the subject is. The erotic side of Cohen’s catalog is one focus among many in “A Crack in Everything,” an exhibition that shows rather than tells.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The curators of the show, John Zeppetelli of the Musée d’Art Contemporain de Montréal, and Victor Shiffman, commissioned artists of various disciplines to develop pieces inspired by Cohen.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Some are simple and quiet, like “Ear on a Worm” from the film artist Tacita Dean, a small image playing on a loop high in the space that shows a perched bird, a reference to “Bird on the Wire” from Cohen’s 1969 album “Songs From a Room.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Some are closer to traditional documentary, like George Fok’s “Passing Through,” which intercuts performances by Cohen throughout his career with video that surrounds the viewer, suggesting the songs are constant and eternal while the performer’s body changes with time.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Candice Breitz’s installation “I’m Your Man (A Portrait of Leonard Cohen)” gathers video portraits of 19 men over the age of 65 singing and humming Cohen’s songs. Each is life-size and high resolution, and the effect of walking through the room is as if the men were present. It’s a breathtaking meditation on fandom, aging and impermanence. (Cohen remained fully immersed in the last two subjects. His final album, “You Want It Darker,” a meditation on his own mortality, was released a month before his death at 82, after

 </a>
 t.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Taken together, the layered work on display in “A Crack in Everything” has a lot to offer on Cohen, but even more to say about how we respond to music, bring it into our lives, and use it as both a balm and an agent for transformation.

 Today, we think of Marvel as the monolithic studio that each year reliably releases two or three blockbusters based on its costume-clad comic-book superheroes. It has built movies like

 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/02/movies/02iron.html?module=inline" title="">
  “Iron Man”
 </a>
 in 2008.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But Marvel’s prosperous future was hardly a certainty a decade or so ago. In the mid-2000s it was a smaller, inexperienced company that controlled the film rights for only a few of its lesser-known characters — other studios had already brought “X-Men,” “Spider-Man” and “Fantastic Four” to theaters — at a time when no one in Hollywood was yet contemplating the idea of an interconnected universe of superhero movies.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 That changed with the help of people like Kevin Feige, who had been an associate producer on “X-Men” before Marvel hired him in 2000; and
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/movies/20carr.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Movies&amp;module=inline&amp;region=EndOfArticle&amp;pgtype=article" title="">
  Robert Downey Jr.
 </a>
 , the veteran actor who was almost no one’s idea of a mass-market magnet when he emerged as a candidate to play Tony Stark, the eccentric billionaire hero of “Iron Man.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In interviews, Feige, now the president of Marvel Studios, and Downey — a star of three “Iron Man”s, four “Avengers” and a “Spider-Man” — spoke about the origins of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the choices they made, and what it’s all meant as “Endgame” approaches. Here are edited excerpts from those conversations.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  KEVIN FEIGE

 In 2006, when we were making our first appearance as our own studio at Comic-Con, the articles written around that were basically: “Marvel’s going to try to make movies themselves now. Too bad they’ve got to scrape the bottom of the barrel.” And I remember feeling, wow, I don’t think it’s the bottom of the barrel.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Initially, there were 10 characters on an official list. And Iron Man was not one of them. Iron Man became one of them when the rights reverted back to Marvel from [New Line Cinema], it instantly went to the top of the list. We were very excited that we could do something different with that film. We had that and
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbqNb2PFKKA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “The Incredible Hulk”
 </a>
 in the same year. And internally, at Marvel corporate, “Hulk” — by far, the better-known property — seemed like the slam-dunk and “Iron Man” seemed like the risk.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  Marvel started hiring cast and crew for “Iron Man” in 2006 — first, the director Jon Favreau and then its star, Robert Downey Jr., both of whom were coming off recent flops.

 And “Zathura” put him in a position to be considered viable and capable of doing an effects-driven movie. And “Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,” if not the best movie I’ve ever done, it’s the one I made the fewest mistakes in as an actor.

 I have a distinct memory of being in this bullpen area of our production office, kicking around ideas with Jon, and Robert’s name came up. We both stopped and looked at each other, like: “Oh, that would be awesome. But nah, you can’t do that. Anyway, who else?” And we kept coming back to that.

 I took a meeting at Marvel. And then I was very pushy, to be honest, which is not really in my nature. But I just had a sneaking suspicion that I had nothing to lose. I decided to take it more seriously than I’d ever taken anything. I felt confident, and then I was told that the meeting went well but I wouldn’t put too much on it, it’s probably not going to go your way. I refused to let go of it.

 I remember saying to a room full of marketing executives: “If we do our job right, the name Tony Stark will be as famous as the name Iron Man. Because unlike a lot of hero movies, this character is as interesting and as engaging outside of his costume, as he is inside of his costume.” [Downey had] not done something like this before, which meant, I felt, a screen test would help convince anybody that needed to be convinced. He, to his credit, was absolutely willing to audition for it.

 We were at an assembly hangar where they made the Spruce Goose. We haven’t started shooting yet and we decide to take out a bunch of pellet pistols and put on protective eyewear, and me and Favreau and a couple other folks literally had a psychotic shootout. And I just thought that was the dumbest, unnecessary, insurance-risk thing I’ve ever done — and that’s really saying something. It was our comic-book D-Day. We knew it was upon us and we were about to start something that could wind up being culturally significant.

 We were at Giorgio Baldi, which is a famous Italian joint. We had a little private room there on Friday night as the numbers came in from Paramount.

 That Monday after the opening weekend, we announced dates for “Iron Man 2,” “Thor,” “Captain America” and “Avengers.” I remember being very excited that the movie worked well enough that we could do this. We’re gonna do the plan! This is going to be a big deal. And the press did not treat it like a big deal. It was a footnote to an article about the success of the “Iron Man” opening weekend.

 The real daunting thing was, oh, that’s right, we have to go do this again. We get a year break, and I stayed very busy that year, and then we had to do it again. The word “franchise” is a verb, if you ask me. You are iterating something that needs to be recreated in some way and expanded upon every time.

 I started to use phrases like “Phase 1 of the MCU,” because I didn’t want to merely think of an “Iron Man” trilogy or a “Thor” trilogy. Which is really the way most people had been conditioned to think about franchises. It all came from the comics — individual characters would occasionally come together for a mega-event limited series, in which everything would change, and then they would go back into their own comics, with the new powers or the new costumes or the psychological changes from that big adventure. That’s what we could do with one phase, and then an “Avengers” movie, a second phase, another “Avengers” movie, and then a third one to close it out.

 The first “Avengers” tour was just mind-bogglingly cool and strange, considering that the film was about to be released but was already being treated like it was a phenomenon. The sheer fact that the world was going, oh, you actually got a lot of actors and actresses to get along for long enough.

 If someone had walked into Giorgio Baldi that night and said, hey guys, I’m 10 Years From The Future Guy, let me tell what you started here. You would just go, “No, what if this goes wrong?” You’d be tripping on the what-if’s. It’s a faith-based activity.

 TOKYO — Cartoonist Monkey Punch, best known as the creator of the Japanese megahit comic series Lupin III, has died at age of 81.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 His office, MP Pictures, said Wednesday that Monkey Punch, whose real name is Kazuhiko Kato, died of pneumonia on April 11.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The story of master thief Lupin's adventures with his gang — gunman Daisuke Jigen, sword master Goemon Ishikawa and sexy beauty Fujiko Mine, as well as a detective, Zenigata — started in 1967.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The cartoon also was adapted for TV animation and movies, some directed by renowned animators including Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Kato himself directed the 1996 animated film "Lupin III: Dead or Alive." Miyazaki, who directed a 1971 Lupin animation for TV, made his feature-length film debut with "Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro" in 1997.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The hard-boiled, yet comical story with a bit of sexy content has quickly won adult comic fans and became a longtime best-seller. Kato's intended readership was adults, and he reportedly has told younger fans to watch Lupin TV animation and read comic books when they become high school students.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The main character in his trademark red jacket is a grandson of famous Arsene Lupin in a Maurice Leblanc detective story.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The son of a fisherman in Hokkaido, in northern Japan, Kato debuted as a professional cartoonist in 1965 while working part time at a rental bookstore, and started using his penname Monkey Punch soon after the Lupin series started in the Weekly Manga Action magazine.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Despite his age, he quickly adapted to digital animation and studied animation on multimedia formats at a technical graduate school in Tokyo in the 2000s. Kato also taught animation at a university in Nishinomiya in western Japan.

  THE ALTRUISTS
 </strong>
 <br/>
 By Andrew Ridker
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Even if it’s true that every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way, it seems pretty clear that many have the same dilemmas and woes. One that frequently pops up in life and literature is an inability or unwillingness to let go of the past and its generations-spanning mistakes, disappointments and resentments.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The tyranny of the past is a central problem in “The Altruists,”
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.andrewridker.com/about" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Andrew Ridker
 </a>
 ’s intelligent, funny and remarkably assured first novel. The book’s family-get-together plot tosses Arthur Alter and his two adult children a chance — possibly their last — to escape their individual ruts of inherited grief, guilt and misguided attempts at altruism, finally connect with one another and move on.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Naturally, things don’t go as planned. Whatever that means for the characters, it’s good news for readers: The clash of reunion expectations and the reality of family ties give Ridker an opportunity to write some of the book’s most comedic and moving scenes and, in doing so, to establish himself as a big, promising talent.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Two years after his wife’s death, Arthur is unraveling. At 65, he’s a disrespected adjunct professor of engineering at a private Midwestern university. “His career was in a coffin, ignored by even the thirstiest of academic vampires.” He’d like to end his relationship with a much younger junior faculty member, but then “he’d have to confront the loneliness that had frightened him into her arms in the first place.” His son and daughter — both living in New York — barely speak to him. Among other unforgivable offenses, Arthur started his affair before their mother’s cancer diagnosis and continued it throughout her decline.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He wakes up one morning broke and at risk of losing the family house in a privileged residential enclave of St. Louis. He misses his children. Sort of. “What he missed was his old life, and his children had been part of that. … The children — and the unexpected money in their name.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ah, yes, the money! This is a substantial sum his wife secretly invested and left to their kids in a last-minute revision to her will. She assessed her husband’s uncharacteristic kindness in her final days and concluded that he had to be sleeping with someone else. “‘Maybe I’m being nice. Can’t I be nice?’ ‘No,’ she said. ‘No, Arthur, I don’t think you can.’” (That comment is a clue to readers about how likely they are to cozy up to Arthur. At least initially.)
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Hoping to hit them up for a loan, Arthur sends terse notes to “the children” proposing they come back to St. Louis for a long weekend. “Important to see family, remember roots, &amp;C.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s not as if Maggie and Ethan Alter have forgotten their roots. If anything, they’re being choked by them. In their late 20s and early 30s respectively, they’re still wrestling with the loss of their mother, Francine, their guilt about the unearned money they inherited from her and their anger at Dad.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Maggie is trying to make a difference in the world, mostly through ineffective self-sacrifice. She’s dumped her corporate boyfriend, lives in a partially boarded-up apartment building and rarely eats. Between fainting spells, she does low-paying odd jobs “for the good people of Queens.” This includes tutoring preteen brothers, one of whom practices martial arts on her. “Maggie tolerated, even welcomed, Bruno’s abuse. … Because that was the thing about trying to do good: You always wound up knuckled in the gut.” Ridker’s satire of ill-conceived do-gooderism is scathing and hilarious, making Maggie both ridiculous and sympathetic.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 While Maggie is starving, Ethan is “girding himself in comfort.” He’s bought a sunny Brooklyn apartment and outfitted it with expensive kitchen appliances he rarely uses. In a fit of moral disgust, he quit his job at a predatory consulting firm and began spending down his savings and his inheritance. When “The Altruists” opens, he’s in debt, single and reclusive. More than one boyfriend has dropped him thanks to his passivity and emotional unavailability. He spends his time reading philosophy as “an antidote to all the screens, a diversion from the Crate and Barrel spirits cabinet with its lacquer exterior and liquor interior.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The siblings, unaware of their father’s financial crisis and with mercenary plans of their own, agree to his suggested visit. They arrive in St. Louis shortly after a tornado has ripped the roof off a concourse at the airport, which kind of says it all.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Andrew Ridker edited an anthology of “surveillance poetics,” published in 2014. That is, poetry dealing with the disappearance of privacy thanks to drones, tracking devices and other tools of voyeurism. He writes sentences with the lively, poetic zing of one as attuned to the sounds of words as to their meanings. “A vast, flocculent cloud darkened and devitalized the city, mimicking the family mood like weather does in memories.” A character’s bald spot is “berated” by rain. His commentary on the cultural eccentricities of pre-Trump middle-class America (the book is set in 2015) is astute and highly entertaining. “His classmates were extremely forthcoming with sensitive information, as though intimacy wasn’t something to be earned, but baby-birded from one mouth to another.” And his descriptions have enough wit and psychological accuracy to make even minor characters spring to multidimensional life. “The dean’s leathery voice was gilded with an aristocratic affect he exhibited tastefully, like a gold watch that spends most of its time tucked under a sleeve.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It is perhaps appropriate that in writing about characters so burdened by the weight of the past, Ridker devotes nearly as many pages to backward glances as he does to present action. In scenes told from alternating points of view — including that of the late matriarch, Francine — he explores, among other things, Ethan’s college days and awkward coming out, Francine’s childhood and adolescence, and Arthur and Francine’s courtship. Most significantly (and with great success) he describes an extended trip Arthur made to Africa when he was in his early 30s and still idealistic. His plan was to use his engineering skills to bring sanitation to rural Zimbabwe. The spectacular failure of his project brings him, literally, to his knees, shapes his future and haunts the entire family for decades to come. Ridker’s ambitious blend of global perspective and intimate human comedy seems likely to evoke comparisons to the work of
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://jonathanfranzen.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Jonathan Franzen
 </a>
 and
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://nathanhill.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Nathan Hill
 </a>
 .
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 As convincing and engaging as these flashbacks are, they do interrupt the main story line that’s set up in the opening chapters, and at times I longed for more unimpeded forward momentum. Maggie and Ethan don’t arrive at that damaged airport until the novel’s midpoint.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 On balance, Ridker’s almost psychoanalytic peeling back of layers of time and experience gets to the heart of the family’s dysfunction while creating characters with true depth. I found myself rooting for the Alters to finally turn a little of their altruism on themselves so that, healed, they could make more effective stabs at doing good elsewhere. The warm ending opens up the possibility of a bright future for them, which is precisely what this outstanding debut suggests for its talented author.

 “Showing audiences an unseen pocket of ‘The Walking Dead’ universe steeped in a new mythology is a very cool way to celebrate a ‘Decade of the Dead’ on TV and over 15 years of Robert Kirkman’s brilliant comic,” Gimple said in a statement announcing the show.

 Many a comic-book origin story movie has had to answer this question, and “Shazam!” approaches it with both a light touch and a heavy splat. In this scene, Zachary Levi plays Billy, a boy recently imbued with new powers (along with an adult body). His foster brother Freddy (Jack Dylan Grazer) helps him figure out just what those powers are in a sequence that involves a painful-looking stunt leap and some pyrotechnics.

 The poll by Reiting research body, the first survey for the election's second round, showed Zelenskiy on 61 percent of votes and incumbent Petro Poroshenko on 24 percent.

 KIEV, Ukraine — Ukraine's president on Thursday ordered the creation of a special anti-corruption court in an apparent attempt to catch up with his challenger, who has taken a commanding lead in the presidential runoff race.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 A poll conducted by the Reiting survey group found comic actor Volodymyr Zelenskiy with 61% support while President Petro Poroshenko had 24% ahead of a runoff set for April 21. The poll released Thursday was based on answers from 3,000 respondents and had a margin of error of 1.8 percentage points.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The 41-year-old comic actor, who plays the role of the nation's president in a hugely popular TV sitcom, has never held political office.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Zelenskiy's popularity, however, reflects public longing for a fresh leader who has no ties to Ukraine's corruption-ridden political elite and can propose a new way to settle the grinding five-year conflict with Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine that has left 13,000 people dead since 2014.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He easily beat Poroshenko in the first round on March 31, garnering 30% of the vote, while the incumbent got just under 16%.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Amid an increasingly heated campaign, Zelenskiy's office on Thursday accused Poroshenko's election headquarters of posting a video in which Zelenskiy is run over by a heavy truck. It said it perceives the video as a clear threat that warrants additional security measures.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Poroshenko's campaign denied that it was responsible for putting out the video and Ukrainian police said they launched a criminal investigation into the incident.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Poroshenko, 53, saw his approval ratings plummet amid Ukraine's economic woes and a sharp plunge in living standards amid a conflict with Russia, which annexed Ukraine's Crimea Peninsula in 2014.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He has cast himself as a strong statesman capable of standing up to Russia, claiming that Zelenskiy's lack of political experience will make him an easy prey for the Kremlin. But even though most of the world has rejected Russia's annexation of Crimea, there are no signs that Ukraine under any political leader is getting the territory back.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Poroshenko also has been repeatedly accused of turning a blind eye to corruption. In addition, the exposure of a military embezzlement scheme that allegedly involved top Poroshenko associates as well as a factory controlled by the president has badly dented his popularity. Poroshenko has denied any links to the scheme.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In an apparent bid to deflect criticism, Poroshenko on Thursday signed a decree to appoint members of the High Anti-Corruption Court — a longtime demand of both the United States and the European Union.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "By setting up the Anti-Corruption Court, we are completing the creation of an independent anti-corruption infrastructure," he said.

 The poll by research body Reiting showed Zelenskiy on 57.9 percent of votes and incumbent Petro Poroshenko on 21.7 percent. Reiting polled 3,000 voters in all regions, except annexed Crimea, from April 12 to 16.

 LOS ANGELES — From gossipy housewives to lovelorn bachelors and lip-syncing drag queens, reality television is getting its own fan event.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Youth channel MTV on Tuesday announced it would host the first reality television convention, where fans and some of the people made famous by shows like "Jersey Shore," "The Real Housewives" and "The Bachelor" will come together to celebrate the genre.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 MTV, whose "The Real World" is credited with launching the modern trend for reality television in 1992, said that the RealityCon event would take place in the summer of 2020.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It will feature performances, interviews and discussions with stars and producers behind some of reality television's most popular series across TV networks, including "Survivor," "Big Brother", "The Hills" and "RuPaul's Drag Race."
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Reality television exploded in the early 2000s when shows like "American Idol," "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" and "Survivor" became some of the most-watched content on U.S. television.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 These shows have also become a driving force in pop culture by increasing ethnic and sexual diversity and breaking formerly taboo topics by casting unknown people from all walks of life. "The Real World" in 1994 was the first to feature an openly gay man with HIV/AIDS on television in its series about a group of young adults living together in the same house in San Francisco.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 MTV said it would announce dates and more details about RealityCon at a later stage.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Comic books and movies like "Star Wars" have held fan conventions around the world for years, often using them as the launching ground for upcoming films, games, television shows and merchandising.

 LOS ANGELES — The directors of "Avengers: Endgame" pleaded with fans on Tuesday not to spoil the movie by giving away storylines after reports that some scenes had leaked online.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In an open letter posted on Twitter under the hashtag #DontSpoilTheEndgame, Joe and Anthony Russo said they and the vast cast of the upcoming Marvel superhero movie "have worked tirelessly for the last three years with the sole intention of delivering a surprising and emotionally powerful conclusion" to the saga.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "When you see Endgame in coming weeks, please don't spoil it for others, the same way you wouldn't want it spoiled for you," they added.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Walt Disney Co's "Avengers: Endgame" marks the conclusion of a story told across 22 Marvel films. The plot has been shrouded in secrecy, with no advance screenings for the entertainment press. Sales of advance tickets earlier this month surpassed those of 2015 movie "Star Wars: The Force Awakens."
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The film, which brings together multiple comic book characters, starts its rollout on April 24 in Australia and China before arriving in the United States on April 25.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Some fans said on Tuesday they had seen brief, grainy scenes on Reddit, YouTube and other platforms, but the footage was swiftly removed. Reuters has not seen the leaked scenes and Disney declined to comment.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The #DontSpoilTheEnding hashtag was one of the top Twitter trends on Tuesday. Some fans who said they had viewed the leaks said they only increased their anticipation for the movie.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "I was upset for about 0.2 seconds then realized how cool it was and it made me so hyped," a person with the user name thestaggie posted on Reddit.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Chris Smith, a contributor to the BGR.com entertainment and tech news site, wrote that he had seen a leak but that it "doesn't really give away the ending" of the movie, although it contained scenes that had not been shown in any of the trailers or official clips released so far.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "I don’t consider that the leak has actually ruined the movie for me. It just makes me want to watch it even more than I already did," wrote Smith.

 KIEV, Ukraine — The comedian who is odds-on favorite in Ukraine's presidential election promised Thursday to hold a nationwide referendum on joining NATO only after building a national consensus on the issue.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a popular comic actor who's leading in the polls far ahead of President Poroshenko, said "we have clearly chosen our path to Europe."
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But he emphasized the need to secure a solid majority backing the country's prospective membership in the alliance.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "It's obvious that NATO means security and the military's high level, but I want to unite the country," he told RBC Ukraine website.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Zelenskiy added that he would appeal to people living in the mostly Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine to dispel their negative view of NATO. "I will record daily video appeals to the eastern regions of Ukraine to tell them that NATO isn't a beast that is going to swallow you," he said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Poroshenko has pushed for Ukraine's membership in NATO and the European Union, though neither alliance is willing to put the country on a track to membership any time soon because of its economic woes, rampant corruption and the five-year conflict with Russia-backed separatist in eastern Ukraine.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The fighting in the east erupted in April 2014 weeks after Russia's annexation of Crimea and the ouster of Ukraine's former Russia-friendly president.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Zelenskiy vowed to make ending hostilities in the east his top priority. In Thursday's interview, he pledged to reach out to people living in the rebel-controlled areas to again make them feel part of Ukraine.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Poroshenko's government has introduced a sweeping transport blockade of separatist territories, making it extremely difficult for the people living there to receive pensions and other social payments.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "I very much hope to make these people feel that Ukraine needs them just as much as they need Ukraine," said Zelenskiy, who won nationwide fame for playing the nation's president in a popular TV sitcom. "It would be necessary to take a lot of humanitarian steps."
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Zelenskiy also said he would push for an early parliamentary election. Ukraine's Supreme Rada is controlled by Poroshenko's ruling party, and the next parliamentary election is due at the end of October.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Zelenskiy said an early parliamentary election of is part of his idea of a "renewal" of the country's ruling elite, but conceded it may take months to make that happen.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The latest opinion poll released Thursday showed the comedian maintaining a massive lead against Poroshenko. Supporters see Zelenskiy as a man who could tackle the nation's economic woes and corruption, but his opponents point to his lack of political experience.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The survey, conducted by the Rating agency, shows Zelenskiy with 58% support while Poroshenko has just 22%. The poll of 3,000 people had a margin of error of 1.8 percentage points.

 KIEV, Ukraine — A young television comic and novice candidate trounced Ukraine’s political elite in the first round of the presidential election, official results showed Monday — a stinging rebuke by an electorate tired of the lack of change in a country dominated by rich businessmen.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 With the initial vote tally nearly complete,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cvk.gov.ua/pls/vp2019/wp300pt001f01=719.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  results released
 </a>
 by the Central Electoral Committee showed that Volodymyr Zelensky, 41, who is famous for playing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/16/world/europe/ukraine-election-tymoshenko-zelensky-poroshenko.html?module=inline" title="">
  a schoolteacher accidentally vaulted into the presidency,
 </a>
 leading the field with more than 30 percent. He received 5.2 million votes, almost double the number of his nearest competitor, President Petro O. Poroshenko, who had just under 16 percent.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Yulia V. Tymoshenko, a former prime minister who has run for president twice before, came in third with more than 13 percent. The turnout was more than 63 percent in an electorate of 30 million, the electoral commission said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Since no candidate garnered more than 50 percent of the vote, Mr. Zelensky and the apparent second-place finisher, Mr. Poroshenko, will face each other in a runoff in three weeks, on April 21.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 As soon as the polls closed on Sunday and exit polls indicated that there would be a runoff, the two leading candidates began bashing each other.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. Zelensky presented himself as an insurgent facing a tired old guard that had refused to take him seriously. He walloped
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/here-are-all-39-candidates-for-president-of-ukraine.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  a field of 38 other candidates
 </a>
 representing different political blocs in Ukraine, most of whom attracted only small fractions of the vote.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 A Zelensky adviser described the outcome as the culmination of a
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/21/world/europe/ukraine.html?module=inline" title="">
  series of uprisings
 </a>
 in Ukraine in 2004 and 2014 that succeeded in overthrowing governments but failed to break the grip of the oligarchs who control economic and political life, as well as the media.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “This is a struggle so that the political system finally starts working not for its own benefit, but for the benefit of the people,” said Dmitri Razumkov, a political consultant for Mr. Zelensky. “Despite two revolutions, nothing has changed in our country.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. Zelensky has been vague about what he would do as president, and at one point tried to crowdsource his program by suggesting that supporters contribute thoughts via social media. Voters might demand more in the second round.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 There have also been suspicions that he is a front for Ihor V. Kolomoisky, a Ukrainian tycoon who fled to Israel
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/12/world/europe/ukraine-central-bank-valeria-gontareva.html?module=inline" title="">
  amid a banking scandal.
 </a>
 Both men have denied any secret pact.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. Poroshenko, 53, conceded on Sunday night that he had lost the confidence of young voters weary over the slow pace of change and the continuing economic woes. But he said that the time for joking was over and that Ukraine needed a leader who could confront both its socioeconomic problems and, more important, the conflict with Russia.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The election will help determine the course of the country that has become the European fault line in renewed global tensions between Russia and the West. The war for control of the Donbass, the regions in eastern Ukraine where government forces are fighting Russian-backed separatists, has claimed 13,000 lives and displaced millions since 2014.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In a sign of the deep rift with Russia, the main rivalry in the presidential race was not, unlike a decade ago, between pro-Russian and pro-Western factions. The leading ally of Russia this time, Yuriy Boyko, was in fourth place, with over 11 percent of the vote.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. Poroshenko faces an uphill battle in a runoff, political analysts said, not least because he remains one of the wealthiest men in Ukraine. His wealth comes from his chocolate empire, and he did not fulfill a 2014 campaign promise to sell his business. Various businessmen close to him have been caught up
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/19/world/europe/ukraine-corruption-military.html?module=inline" title="">
  in scandals involving corruption.
 </a>
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The president continued to grow richer as ordinary Ukrainians suffered from low wages and unemployment, noted Volodymr Fesenko, a political analyst.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The election outcome echoes a global trend of tossing out established political leaders in favor of candidates who promise a complete national overhaul, Mr. Fesenko and other analysts said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “The victory of Zelensky is a protest against the old elites and the request for radical political change, a radical update,” said Mr. Fesenko, chairman of a think tank called the
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://penta.org.ua/about/experts/155/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Center for Applied Political Studies
 </a>
 . It is not so much love for the comedian as “the expectation that he can become a catalyst for change,” he said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ukrainians seem less enamored of their leaders all the time. A mere 9 percent voiced confidence in the government, and 91 percent see it as corrupt,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://bit.ly/2UcUtLG" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  according to a Gallup poll conducted in March.
 </a>
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In Russia, Dmitri S. Peskov, the spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin, declined to comment on the first-round voting results. Russia’s main interest is seeing a candidate prevail who will work toward a gradual settlement of the conflict in Donbass, he said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Other Russian political leaders and the state-run media tried to present the Ukrainian election as a farce and a rebuke to the idea that a political uprising like that in Ukraine in 2014 could force change. Rossiyskaya Gazeta, the government newspaper, said there were signs of “massive violations and falsifications in these elections — the dirtiest and most dishonest in the history of Ukraine.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Russian reports and commentary ignored the widespread perception that the election in Ukraine was democratic, with a real choice and an outcome that was not preordained — unlike elections in Russia. Only minor election law violations have been reported thus far.

 Second Coming, a comic-book series with Jesus Christ as a character, is getting a second chance after DC Comics canceled it last month before its release. The series, written by
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/Manruss" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mark Russell
 </a>
 and drawn by
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/rpace" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 , will be published by
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://comicsahoy.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  AHOY Comics
 </a>
 this summer. In the satirical comic, Jesus has a superhero roommate named Sunstar and learns what has become of his Gospel on earth.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Russell said his inspiration for Second Coming was to tell a story about power, in particular about how society “has fetishized physical violence and force as being the solution to every problem.” During a recent telephone interview, Russell said his goal was to examine that notion “by having a superhero who’s bought into this ideology being forced to confront somebody who has a completely different approach to human dynamics. Christ seemed like the natural standard-bearer for that nonviolent approach.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The series was originally announced in July 2018 at San Diego Comic-Con. The next month, Russell discussed his plans
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.bleedingcool.com/2018/08/25/jesus-superhero-mark-russell/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  in an interview with Bleeding Cool
 </a>
 , a website devoted to pop culture. “The conceit is that God was so upset with Jesus’s performance the first time he came to Earth, since he was arrested so soon and crucified shortly after, that he has kept him locked up since then,” he said.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 There was no adverse reaction until January, when news about the comic was reported by outlets like the

  online petition
 </a>
 asking DC to pull the series from its publication schedule garnered more than 235,000 signatures. The petition described the comic as inappropriate, and asked, “Can you imagine the media and political uproar if DC Comics was altering and poking fun at the story of Muhammad … or Buddha?” DC canceled the title on Feb. 13.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Russell said that Second Coming, which will run for at least six issues starting July 10, is respectful of what Christians “profess to believe.” He added, “It’s not as respectful as to what they actually do. It’s not a satire of Christ so much as it is a satire on how his followers of the last 2,000 years have turned his message of forgiveness and empathy into one of power and domination, which is as un-Christlike as one can possibly imagine.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This is not the first time the writer has taken on God. In 2013, Russell wrote “
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1603090983/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_U_x_fh4mCbS1GAT9D" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  God Is Disappointed in You
 </a>
 ,” with illustrations by Shannon Wheeler, which promised to strip the Bible of its arcane language to get to its core message.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The artist Richard Pace was recruited by the original editor of Second Coming when it was planned for Vertigo, an imprint of DC Comics, and he said he was intrigued by the mix of religion and satire. “I’m not afraid of that, so I said sure,” Pace recalled. He said he has received death threats since the project was announced.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “No one has read the book other than the people who are working on it,” Pace said. “I know full well that the only person coming out of it looking good is Jesus.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Pace will lay out each issue and draw the scenes in heaven and in biblical times, while a second artist, who has not yet been named, will handle the scenes set on earth. “It gives us a chance to have a really visual indication of where the reader is in a story,” he said.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Another interpretation of Jesus can be found in a hardcover graphic novel to be released on March 20 by Image Comics. “Jesusfreak,” by Joe Casey and Benjamin Marra, is described on the publisher’s website as telling a violent

 </a>
 as “a kung fu demon slayer” who is “grappling with his station in life, the politics of the era, and divine martial art energies.” The book was

  2,800 signatures
 </a>
 .
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both Russell and Pace said that the delay in publication and the move from DC to AHOY has given them time to improve Second Coming. The first issue will include six extra pages that recount Christ’s memories of a childhood friend during his first visit to earth. And DC had requested some changes — like less coarse language and adding fig leaves to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden — that are no longer necessary. While Russell was ready to make them, he knew more would be coming, he said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “That’s what made me realize that this was going to slowly turn into a more watered-down version of what I had originally envisioned,” he said. When he asked for the rights of the project to be returned, DC agreed.

</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Peyer said he was not worried about the strong prepublication reaction to the series. “I don’t think a comic book is anything to get that upset about,” he said. “I just think it’s a really good story that people have a right to read.”

 American Ronin, about highly trained corporate operatives; Fight Girls, about warriors vying to be queen of the galaxy; and Bad Mother, about a parent searching for her missing daughter: These are some of the stories that are coming from a new comics publisher, Artists, Writers &amp; Artisans, one that is posing the question, what stories could we develop if we begin with a blank slate?
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In comic books, there are two main publishing models. One emphasizes flagship characters — like Batman and Spider-Man — whose success largely benefits their companies, DC and Marvel Comics. The other is creator-focused, where hits like The Walking Dead, by Robert Kirkman and published by Image Comics, can mean a financial windfall for its creators. AWA is aiming for something between the two: It will have interconnected superhero comics like DC and Marvel as well as stand-alone series like Image. And all of its creators will have a financial stake.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s an approach reminiscent of old Hollywood. “The model here really is the old United Artists model, where people who are actually doing the creative have ownership, control and decision-making power over the work that they’re doing,” said Bill Jemas, a former chief operating officer and publisher at Marvel who is the chief executive and publisher of AWA. Joining him at the helm are Axel Alonso, a former editor in chief at Marvel, as chief creative officer and Jonathan F. Miller as chairman. Miller helped broker a deal in 2017 between the comic book writer
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/behind-netflixs-bold-bet-comics-king-mark-millar-1031336" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mark Millar and Netflix
 </a>
 , which bought his library of characters for development on the streaming service. Jemas and Alonso say the first of AWA’s titles will arrive some time this fall.

 “What we’re offering creators is an opportunity to bet on themselves without putting it all on the line,” Alonso said, during a recent conference-call interview with Jemas. Their stable of writers and artists includes both veterans and newcomers, Alonso said. They would be paid to produce the work as well as own their stories and characters, a percentage of the company or both.

  announced itself in December
 </a>
 , plans to binge-release its mini-series, simultaneously selling collected editions of those stories and offering the first issue of each comic free. AHOY Comics, which began publishing in September, is more old school, but it is trying new things: It includes extra material — prose stories, cartoons, even a crossword — in its issues, and is also publishing

 AWA has its own biblical title, Archangel 8, which is written by Michael Moreci and is about one of God’s angels who goes rogue.

 To help shape the comics, the publisher has a creative council, which includes the screenwriter and director Reginald Hudlin, the novelists

 </a>
 for MGM. “I was open to returning to comics if the project was something challenging, so when Bill and Axel approached me about creating an entirely new, cohesive, shared comic-book universe, the prospect was too much fun to resist,” he wrote in an email. Straczynski has developed the origin point of AWA’s superheroes.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He has worked for comic companies with different publishing models. At DC and Marvel, “you always kind of know where the guard rails are,” he noted, including an obligation to bend, but not break the characters. With creator-owned work, “you can go as far as you want, since only you bear the consequences if you mess it up,” he wrote. Straczynski was drawn to the blended approach of AWA. “You get to create a new universe for what has every opportunity to become a major company, while taking real chances.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In developing AWA’s superhero universe, Straczynski and Alonso took a broad look at others. Straczynski postulated that DC’s heroes, which generally emerged out of the postwar ’40s, were largely authority figures, while Marvel’s, which mostly emerged from the ’60s, were anti-establishment. “Who are we writing our stories about, and for, and what are we trying to say that’s relevant to a contemporary audience?” he wrote.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 AWA has big ambitions and hopes to create a library of material like that of Marvel. “I think it’s fairly safe to say that Marvel is the most valuable entertainment franchise in the world,” Miller said. After the Netflix deal, he wondered if there were similar opportunities. He and Jemas got together, and Alonso soon joined them. “One of the great things about doing things this way is that you get to try a lot. Some things will hit, you never know when and where, but that’s part of the idea,” he said. “As long as you keep getting your turns at bat, then you’ll get some hits.”
</p><p class="css-1e7dx92 evys1bk0">
 An earlier version of this article misidentified Bill Jemas’s role at Marvel. He was chief operating officer and publisher, not a vice president.

 HONG KONG — An Instagram account featuring a comic strip with gay Muslim characters disappeared on Wednesday, days after Indonesian officials threatened to block the entire social media platform in the country because of an uproar over the comic’s content.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The episode is the latest flash point in a slow-burning battle over morality and civil rights in Indonesia, a Muslim-majority nation. Even as gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people in the country assert themselves, others support an ascendant Islamic movement that has embraced some homophobic policies and portrayed L.G.B.T. people as a threat to national harmony.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Instagram account, @Alpantuni, first appeared in January with the tagline “Gay Muslim comics for people who are able to think.” Its Indonesian-language comics addressed gay identity and religious bigotry, and depicted men with their shirts off and in bed together, though never fully nude.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The account prompted a flurry of criticism on social media in the country, with some accusing the artist of pornography or blasphemy.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “God created humans as man and woman, a couple, and there is no third sex,” Muhyiddin Junaidi, a representative of the
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/07/world/asia/07indo.html?module=inline" title="">
  Council of Ulemas
 </a>
 , a quasi-governmental body of Muslim scholars, said in a telephone interview.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “For us, being L.G.B.T. is a psychological illness that needs to be cured, and this comic is promoting it,” he added. “That will ruin the people’s faith in the long term.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Indonesia’s Information Ministry sent Instagram a letter on Feb. 2 asking the company to remove the account, arguing that it violated an Indonesian law on distributing pornography, said Ferdinandus Setu, a ministry spokesman. He said the ministry had also threatened to shut Instagram down in Indonesia if it did not comply with the request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. Setu said that the post was removed early on Wednesday and that Instagram had taken down an account with a nearly identical name a few weeks earlier, at the ministry’s request.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But Instagram said on Wednesday that it had decided not remove the @Alpantuni account, which had nearly 6,000 followers, after determining that it had not violated the company’s “
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  community guidelines
 </a>
 .”
 <br/>
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “There are a number of other reasons why an account may no longer be accessible, including, for example, if the account holder deleted the account, deactivated the account or changed the account user name,” said Ching Yee Wong, the company’s head of Asia-Pacific communications.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Instagram did not respond to a question about whether it had previously taken down accounts with similar names, and the owner of the @Alpantuni account could not be reached for comment.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 There was speculation that the account might be based in nearby Malaysia.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Among other suggestions, Instagram’s community guidelines instruct users to refrain from posting nudity and to “always follow the law.” The company said on Wednesday that people should report Instagram content that violates the guidelines or “makes them feel uncomfortable.”

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Some characters in the comics are criticized by others as “stupid,” “uncivilized” and “godless” for being gay. The Coconuts report said that the comments on the strip’s Instagram account were “overwhelmingly hateful (and a pretty accurate reflection of the L.G.B.T. haters depicted in the comic itself).”

 “It’s your right to be godless, but do not be both Muslim and gay,” wrote another. “That is just greedy.”

 Brody Stevens, a jarring comic who turned his own struggles with depression into a Comedy Central television series, died on Friday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 48.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Los Angeles County medical examiner-coroner’s office ruled the death a suicide.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. Stevens was well known in the stand-up world, especially on the West Coast, as well as to studio audiences of shows like “Chelsea Lately” and “The Burn With Jeff Ross.” For those shows he was the warm-up comedian, whose job was to get the audience in a laughing mood before taping began.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYFCTND-r3g" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  His stand-up style
 </a>
 was a seemingly contradictory mix of confrontation and self-deprecation. He would often mock the fact that he was not a household name and had managed to land only small parts in television shows and movies.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “I was in the ‘Hangovers,’ ” he joked in a favorite routine. “‘Hangover 1’: In it. ‘Hangover 2’: In it. ‘Due Date’: In it. ‘Funny People’: I got cut out of that.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Onstage he raced quickly through a wide array of subject matter, going deeper and darker than comfort-food comedians. When his audiences responded with nervous half-laughs or silence, he would turn on them with something on the edge of genuine hostility.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “You should be giving me laughs based on cadence alone” was one of his favorite lines for berating a crowd. “I scratch your back, you shave mine.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He was widely admired by other comedians for his willingness to venture into unsafe territory.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Brody never seems like he’s doing material at all,” Sarah Silverman once said. “He’s just yelling.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 She gave that assessment in the premiere episode of “Brody Stevens: Enjoy It!,” a biographical documentary series (based on an earlier HBO web series) broadcast on Comedy Central in 2013 and 2014. Among the things it examined was a disturbing period in which Mr. Stevens stopped taking his anti-anxiety medications and went on a days-long sleep-deprived rant, much of it blasted in a stream of Twitter messages and videos. The behavior so alarmed his friends — especially when he tweeted that he had a gun — that they called the authorities, and Mr. Stevens was committed for psychiatric treatment.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “They diagnosed me here at the U.C.L.A. psych ward with a bipolar disorder,” he said in Episode 2 of “Enjoy It!”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “I don’t want it to make who I am,” he added, “ ‘I’m the guy who had this breakdown.’ But I’ll talk about it, and be real, learn from it, help others learn from it, and then move on.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. Stevens was born Steven James Brody to Harold and Jackie Brody on May 22, 1970, in California’s San Fernando Valley. His parents divorced when he was young.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He played baseball at Reseda High School and received a scholarship to Arizona State University, where he was a pitcher. His love of baseball continued past his playing days, and he was a frequent visitor to spring training camps.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He honed his stand-up skills in Seattle, where he also had a public-access TV show, then returned to the Los Angeles area. The actor and producer Zach Galifianakis became a close friend and, with Mike Gibbons, created “Enjoy It!,” which ran for 12 episodes. Another theme of that show was Mr. Stevens’s strained relationship with his sister, Stephanie.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Information on his survivors was not immediately available.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. Stevens, who in recent years went by the name Steven Brody Stevens, also hosted audio and video podcasts. On Twitter, the comedian John Roy recalled an industry show in which a number of comics performed for hard-to-amuse agents. The crowd, he said, was comatose until Mr. Stevens took the stage and virtually demanded laughs, finally loosening things up.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “He gave that gift to every comic that came after him that night,” Mr. Roy wrote. “That’s why he was such a master at warming up TV shows. He simply refused to accept that audiences could not be made to laugh, and he threw every thought and instinct he had at that problem until it was solved.”

  IDW Publishing

  Dark Horse Comics
 </a>
 since 1995 and was primarily printed in black-and-white.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Sakai, 65, said in a telephone interview on Wednesday that the series is “mainly fantasy and action and adventure, but there’s a lot of teaching there, too,” as it is set in an anthropomorphic version of 17th-century Japan. “I draw from that history and culture and folklore to make my stories,” he said.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Previous installments have shown the craftsmanship of forging swords, the construction of massive paper kites and examined the role of Christian missionaries who went to Japan. The new series, which will be colored by
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/TomLuth" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Usagi Yojimbo has a rabid following and is critically acclaimed. The site Comics Alliance ran an article, “

 It’s not just that the boys’ names scan so similarly. Or that both shows are about fatherless families: Evan’s the result of divorce; Simon’s the result of an accident. The opening songs (“

</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 More fundamentally, both “Superhero” and “Dear Evan Hansen” show how damaged people try to use stories, whether fictional or outright false, to rebuild themselves after trauma — and how they may create new traumas in the process.

 ) have somehow created a musical so lugubrious and underpowered that it never gets off the ground.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The problem is built into the low-stakes, high-whimsy concept. The 15-year-old Simon (Kyle McArthur) is not a spectacular social media liar like Evan; he is merely an aficionado and amateur author of comic books, hooked on their tales of rescue. They allow him to imagine characters, like the Amazing Sea-Mariner, who “can heal the world’s suffering and pain” — if only in his sketchbook.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In the real world, he feels isolated at a new school and smothered at home by his worried mother, Charlotte (
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/20/arts/music/kate-baldwin-shows-her-range-at-54-below.html?module=inline" title="">

 ). He’d like a girlfriend but is too shy even to defend his dynamic schoolmate Vee (Salena Qureshi) when an ex tries to bully her.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 These are not exactly shattering — or shatteringly original — problems. Despite Mr. McArthur’s angsty singing, Simon basically comes off as a nice boy with a big imagination and, for a high school sophomore, few objections to setting the table.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s Charlotte who isn’t coping well. (Piling on the pathos, Mr. Logan tells us she is named for the title character of “Charlotte’s Web.”) An assistant professor of English, she has worked only intermittently in the two years since her husband’s death, holing up instead in a new apartment after moving from the family’s more comfortable home. It is evidently meant as some kind of irony that she is a specialist in

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 I will not spoil how “Superhero” manages to tie both Simon’s and Charlotte’s stories together with that of the man in apartment 4B. He is Jim (

 ), a shy bus driver with a big secret and dreamy blue eyes. Let’s just say that accepting his role in the proceedings requires an almost-literal

  willing suspension of disbelief
 </a>
 .
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 I was unwilling. Not even as allegory could the fantastical adventure that swallows the second act sustain my interest; its concerns are sketchy, as thin as comic book stock. Despite spending so much energy hammering the unlikely plot into place, Mr. Logan, author of the Tony Award-winning “
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/02/theater/reviews/02red.html?module=inline" title="">

 </a>
 ,” has not created characters who connect his overworked variations on superhero conventions convincingly to real behavior.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Nor, to my surprise, do Mr. Kitt’s songs enrich the storytelling the way they did in “
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/16/theater/reviews/16norm.html?module=inline" title="">

 .” The music does at times prove effective in setting scenes; the first sounds we hear are a heroic horn call delightfully referencing
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78N2SP6JFaI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  John Williams’s theme for “Superman,”
 </a>
 albeit with just one horn.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But if the orchestrations, by Mr. Kitt and Michael Starobin, are atypically wan, Mr. Kitt’s lyrics are even wanner. Perhaps that’s because “Superhero” is the first of his musicals for which he has also written the words. They seem as withdrawn as Simon, not wanting to call attention to themselves with anything but the mushiest phrases and most reticent rhymes — a timidity that lets the ear write them off as unimportant.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 That Ms. Baldwin nevertheless makes a great deal and a great meal of them is a sign of her tremendous stage intelligence. A should-have-been musical star who recently graduated to second bananahood (
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/04/theater-review-and-the-word-on-bette-midler-as-dolly-is.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 </a>
 in “Hello, Dolly!”), she seems to create a full-color story for each pale lyric, then spin it out on ribbons of unimpeachable sound. Even outside the songs, her characterization is the most convincing thing in the show, and her purely nonallegorical scenes with Mr. Pinkham, also in fine voice, are the most satisfying beyond their washes of purpleness.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But it does not grant much to “Superhero” to say that its leads manage to rise above it. Or to say that Mr. Moore (also the director of “

Psychological musicals, in which interior landscapes are foregrounded and characters sing soliloquies that can easily devolve into clichés, are extremely difficult to pull off. “Dear Evan Hansen” succeeds because its songs are so sharply pointed and its emotional life is convincingly bonded to an ingenious, almost inevitable plot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Without that — without a tough skin of credible story and clear reasons to sing — shows like “Superhero,” however glorious their provenance and whoever comes to their rescue, are never going to fly.

 If Dave Attell ever retires, as he has
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GntEGCbyTDo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  periodically hinted for years,
 </a>
 what will become of club comedy?
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Comics will still work clubs, of course. But in an era when the savvy career move is to diversify into podcasts and video while playing a variety of rooms, Attell, 54, is the rare elite stand-up who advertises himself, with a mixture of pride and self-deprecation, as
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/redeye/culture/redeye-dave-attell-club-comic-20151006-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  simply a club comic
 </a>
 . More important: No one alive makes a better argument for the aesthetic of New York club comedy, with its tussling crowd work, quick setups and ruthless punch lines that go for the gut.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 For 32 years, he has performed nearly every night of the week, making him a longer-running fixture in this city than “The Phantom of the Opera,” and one that has aged better, although you might not know it at first glance.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 On a cold weeknight this month at the Comedy Cellar, where he often appears on the late show, he walked onstage looking rumpled, sporting a baggy winter coat and a headwear situation that resembled a Russian nesting doll: After removing a hoodie that covered his customary black baseball cap, which he took off to reveal yet another hat, he began his set with a knowing quip: “I look like I just came here to get warm.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Attell has been describing himself like this for decades. “I have a gym in my building,” he said in
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzUooSwSTEE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  his 1996 HBO half-hour
 </a>
 . “Does anyone else live in the Y?”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Attell actually has had a successful showbiz career, which includes host of cult shows on Comedy Central (“Insomniac”) and Showtime (“Dave’s Old Porn”), along with brief stints on “The Daily Show” and “Saturday Night Live.” But he’s more revered by peers than the public. He has never put out specials as frequently as he could have. His easygoing double act,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80216094" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Bumping Mics”
 </a>
 with Jeff Ross, which debuted last fall on Netflix, was his first release since 2014.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 What Attell does best doesn’t lead to fame and fortune these days. It’s not just that he’s an old-school performer in a media landscape biased toward novelty and provocation. Making noise in the crowded comedy scene today means going personal, political or controversial. Attell generally avoids all three. You can watch him for hours and learn next to nothing about his life or his deepest convictions outside an abiding faith in punchy jokes.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He has one of the quickest minds in comedy, and gently insulting audiences is critical to his act, adding tension, unpredictability and a change of pace. At a terrific 90-minute or so show in December at Caroline’s, where I sat in the front row, he treated me like a speed bag, jabbing me with punch lines about my glasses (“Isaac Asimov’s grandson”), posture (“Stephen Hawking’s stunt double”) and snack-food preference. When I said rice cracker, he responded, “What’s your favorite porn — homework?”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 At his core, Attell is a high-octane, no-frills joke machine, a delivery system for punch lines, some improvised, but a vast majority rigorously honed. With a compulsive work ethic, he tests the same jokes for years, tweaking words repeatedly to find the funniest sound. He doesn’t add many act-outs to sell a line or weave bits into a story to build comic momentum. If you transcribe his jokes and read them aloud flatly, they remain funny.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 His comedy doesn’t carry a message, but it does have a specific mood and texture that has shifted over the years. He built his reputation on a dirty and dissolute image, focusing on sex toys, drinking and ornate literary descriptions of testicles. (My favorite might be when he compared them to a “tent no one knows how to fold up.”)
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 If you listen closely to his 2014 Comedy Central special, “Road Work,” you can hear the roots of some of the button-pushing humor of Louis C.K., albeit in quicker form. “Ever do a bunch of mushrooms, think you’re having a pillow fight, but it turns out to be a live baby,” goes one joke.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Attell isn’t as raunchy as he once was. As he has gotten older, he has added more jokes about food and pets. He will still predict how a night might end for audience members based on what they’re drinking, but now that he’s sober, there aren’t as many punch lines about Jägermeister.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He has his off nights, and his crowd work can be tentative. (Jeff Ross is a good match, prodding him to take more risks.) But there are moments when I see Attell perform that I think he is only now entering his prime, something this famously self-critical comic would probably disagree with.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Stick around long enough, and you acquire a certain gravitas, no matter how ragged and unpretentious you may be. Attell is far too wedded to the economical structure of hard jokes to veer off into the poetic flourishes of Dave Chappelle, and he seems to have little interest in waging culture wars.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But see him perform enough, and a theme emerges: close attention paid to the lonely and overlooked figures of our society, particularly in an unforgiving city. He has a wonderful bit imagining the guy who sells fruit on Sixth Avenue at 4 a.m. and another extended metaphor in which he pictures himself carrying a lantern through a thick fog, saying “fog things” like “Friend or foe?”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 His material has the landscape of a Tom Waits song, crusty and cynical, inspiring bleak laughter that sounds as if it might turn into a cough at any moment. Attell has built a comic world that perfectly fits the character he has long played onstage, one with a past he can plumb for a few extra laughs.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Around midnight at the Comedy Cellar another night this month, Attell invited his audience to imagine the loneliness of a worker making Subway sandwiches in an empty restaurant. After setting the scene more economically than I have, with him waiting for his food, he describes watching this employee and deciding to make “his smallest dream come true.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 With a conspiratorial glance to one side, he said, “Take the gloves off.” Then he hit the audience with two more punch lines, instructing this sad sack to live his best life. “Raw dog it. Put the mayonnaise wherever you want.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Like New York itself, Dave Attell is not as dirty as he used to be, but he can still make a joke about cold cuts sound deliriously filthy.

 ANGOULÊME, France — It’s a big year for comic book anniversaries. Batman’s 80th is this year, and Asterix is turning 60. But at the Angoulême International Comics Festival in France, which finished on Sunday, there was a sense that the form’s best days may be yet to come — in the French-speaking world, at least.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “It’s a kind of golden age,” said Jean-Luc Fromental, a comic book author who also runs a graphic-novel imprint for the publisher Denoël. “There has never been so much talent. There have never been so many interesting books published.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 There are now more comic books published annually in France and Belgium than ever before, according to the festival’s artistic director, Stéphane Beaujean. “The market has risen from 700 books per year in the 1990s to 5,000 this year,” he said in an interview. “I don’t know any cultural industry which has had that kind of increase.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Research by the market research company GfK, released to coincide with the festival, showed that turnover in the comic book industry in those two countries alone reached 510 million euros, or around $580 million, in 2018.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The bumper year in France and Belgium contrasts with a mixed situation worldwide. Comichron, a website that reports on comic book sales in the United States, where the market is worth around $1 billion, says that sales there are declining.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But in terms of respect and recognition, comics are on the way up. In July, “Sabrina,” by the American artist Nick Drnaso, became
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/23/books/booker-prize-graphic-novel-ondaatje.html?module=inline" title="">
  the first graphic novel to be nominated for the Man Booker Prize
 </a>
 , Britain’s most prestigious literary award. “March: Book Three,” a graphic novel about the civil rights movement, won the National Book Award for Young People’s Literature in 2016.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In Angoulême, a city about 450 kilometers, or 280 miles, southwest of Paris, comic books aren’t merely an annual preoccupation. Visitors arriving by train are greeted outside the station by an obelisk honoring René Goscinny, one of the creators of Asterix. There’s a comics museum, and a comics library.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The festival, spread out in venues across the city, featured comic books on just about every conceivable subject — the life of Jules Verne, the wines of Burgundy, erotic stories set in space, even one whose
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://davanhzoo.fr/boutique/bd/a-meme-le-sol/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  main character is a gym sock
 </a>
 . The St.-Martial church was repurposed as a shop specializing in comic book titles for Christian readers, whether modern spiritual tales or retellings of Bible stories.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Angoulême event is unusual in its embrace of comics from around the world, including, but not limited to, those from the three traditions that dominate the form here: French-Belgian, American and Japanese manga. “It’s the only place in the world where you can see all the comics created in the world,” said Beaujean, who this year has doubled the size of an area where publishers can buy rights to international titles.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Books featuring classic characters like Donald Duck, Wonder Woman and Tintin were available in both freshly-printed form and as secondhand rarities. And while occasional encounters with men in superhero outfits are unavoidable at an event like this, Angoulême has a very different atmosphere from its American counterparts such as Comic-Con.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “In America, it’s about the pop culture, which would include everything from Marvel movies to Lego,” said the American comic book artist Terry Moore, the author of a 26-year-old series, “Strangers in Paradise.” “In France, I’m seeing that it’s about books, books, books,” he said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 On Saturday, France’s culture minister, Franck Riester, gave a speech comparing the event’s role in the world of comics to that of the Cannes Film Festival in cinema, and Jean-Michel Blanquer, the education minister, visited on Thursday. The attendance by government officials underscored the way the “ninth art,” as comic books are sometimes referred to in France, is not a niche pursuit but a mainstream activity.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Angoulême festival announces a number of prizes each year, their recipients chosen by fellow comics artists. This year, for the first time, women won both of the festival’s biggest awards. A jury of seven artists selected the debut graphic novel by the American author Emil Ferris, “My Favorite Thing Is Monsters,” as winner of the Fauve d’Or, or Golden Wildcat award, for the year’s best book.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Japanese Manga artist Rumiko Takahashi won the Grand Prix, the festival’s lifetime achievement award. Takahashi began publishing manga comics in 1978 and her books, including “Inuyasha,” about a time-traveling schoolgirl, have sold more than 200 million copies. She is only the second woman to win the prize.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Angoulême is a cornerstone of the comics industry in France and Belgium, but some in the field say the exuberant headlines conceal a more complex picture. A common refrain is that the huge increase in titles has meant that, while there’s more money in the industry, there are also a greater number of authors grasping for a share of it.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Benoît Peeters, an author of comic books who has also written a biography of the philosopher Jacques Derrida, said in an interview that despite the increase in overall readership, “the sales of each book, except for those like Asterix and manga, are going down.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Peeters founded an organization called
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.etatsgenerauxbd.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  The General State of Comics
 </a>
 to lobby publishers and the French government to defend the interests of comic book artists.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He said that publishers were hedging their bets by signing up for too many books, with smaller titles often receiving inadequate support as a result. “I think the publishers need to make some choices,” he said. “When they choose a book they have to defend it and promote it.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But in France, at least, comic books were taken seriously as an art form, Peeters said. “When I was a young author I came from a more literary world,” he said. “People said, ‘What are you doing with comics? You are a clever person. You should work with movies or literature.’ Now, nobody would say that.”

 The comic Jaboukie Young-White has a bit examining which bugs are gay.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Bees worship a queen, so of course. Ladybugs, he says, are clearly all lesbians. And when it comes to ants, he flashes a pensive look, his sleepy eyes opening wider as he asks, “You’re working
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  so
 </em>
 hard — what are you hiding?”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Then Young-White, 24, pauses, waiting for the joke to sink in. Typically, he moves from punch line to punch line with pace, but the two times I have seen him tell this one, he went silent as the laughter built. It’s a veteran move from a relative newcomer: When a joke glances off its target, as opposed to thumping it, he holds the silence to let you know the laugh is there if you look for it.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In the season premiere of the
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RntD8uBVoQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  HBO series “Crashing,”
 </a>
 on Sunday, Young-White plays a version of himself, a precocious comic with a herky-jerky delivery whom the star, Pete Holmes, persuades to come to New York, where he helps him gain entree to the club scene. But it’s a sign of how rapidly Young-White has risen that this plotline seems dated. Only a few months after he started work on “The Daily Show” in October, he headlined at Caroline’s, selling out five shows. It might not have seemed like it when “Crashing” hired him, but right now that series probably benefits from his glow more than the other way around.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 While he hasn’t made a Netflix special, it’s probably only a matter of time, since Young-White, who has had nearly as much success writing (the Netflix series “Big Mouth” and “American Vandal”) as doing stand-up, has already developed the building blocks of a killer debut: sharp introductory jokes about his look and name (the stand-up version of a series pilot setting the scene), a clearly defined point of view that balances the prickly with the ingratiating, and an effortless star charisma that cannot be taught.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But it’s his craftsmanship that might be most impressive. He deftly delivers a punch line, but he’s even better at setting up a premise, careful not to get ahead of his audience, establishing the idea with the patience and conviction of a Broadway pro crying on cue years into a run.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The first indication that he was an unusually assured stand-up was his 2017 debut on “The Tonight Show,” where he opened with a joke about how, racially, he’s perceived differently from city to city. “When I’m in Chicago, people just think I’m half black, half white. When I’m in New York, people think that I’m Puerto Rican. But when I’m in CVS, everyone thinks I’m stealing.” Another long pause, over 10 seconds, as the crowd applauds, before he pivots: “It’s really frustrating, because I am.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The joke established the perspective of a comic who pokes fun at racial pigeonholes and stereotypes while also being occasionally willing to play into them. “I don’t want to be the kind of comic who says black people are like this and white people are like that,” he said at one show, before doing just that.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In his first “Tonight Show” set, he also came out to his parents as gay. But it wasn’t only what he was saying that telegraphed an impressive ambition. It was his choice of clothes, a red leather jacket, nodding to
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0uNfFQY5XU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  the famous suit in “Delirious,”
 </a>
 the breakthrough special of Eddie Murphy, then in his early 20s, perhaps the most spectacularly successful of all the stand-up prodigies.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Whereas Murphy began his career with jokes that presented gay men as silly, strange or even dangerous, Young-White is more likely to speak of a heterosexual couple as something alien. (“You’ve heard of those? It’s when a man and woman fall in love and go to Ikea.”) But he’s also not above telling a derivative joke.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Explaining how he is addicted to his phone, he describes a mugger asking him: “Is your phone worth your life?”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Young-White stares blankly: “I thought, Hmmm.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Comedy nerds will notice the echo of Jack Benny’s classic joke about his own frugality. When a
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tVzdUczMT0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  stickup artist demands, “Your money or your life!,” Benny answers, “I’m thinking it over!”
 </a>
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But as much as originality matters in stand-up, its importance is easy to exaggerate. As with magic tricks or story structures, there is a limited number of kinds of new jokes, but an infinite variety of ways to pull them off. What Young-White has done is update Benny for millennial comedy, leaning on a classic joke form to serve the perspective of a young person who lives much of his life staring at a screen.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 On “The Daily Show,” he also leans into jokes about his age, playing the part of the Senior Youth Correspondent. But his sharpest social commentary is filtered through a personal prism. In between punch lines, Young-White narrates his own story, giving the audience a clear sense of his background, describing his Jamaican family with two brothers (one straight, one bisexual) growing up in Chicago where he was taught sex education by nuns in a Catholic school. As an adult, he lived in that city with seven roommates, including an actual gay man living in a closet (the setup to one of his better punch lines) before moving to Los Angeles just long enough to develop a loathing of it to bring to New York.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 His stories position him as a struggling outsider, but not in a way that invites sympathy. Young-White can be cutting, but it’s always with a smile and an eye roll. There’s a carefree attitude to his comedy, a sense that even when faced with the most difficult or prejudiced situation, he can escape with a quick gibe. He has several stories about confrontations with homophobes, including one on a subway and another on Twitter, but they end with his defeating them with his quick wit.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When discussing his father’s lashing out after learning his son was gay, Young-White does not treat the event as overly dramatic. In his telling, he doesn’t return fire or build up the significance of the exchange. Instead, his response to his father is more unexpected, a kind of glib irritation: “You’re being
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  such
 </em>
 a queen right now,” he tells his dad, in a sing-songy voice. “This is kind of my moment.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It certainly is.
</p><p class="css-1e7dx92 evys1bk0">
 An earlier version of this article misstated the season-premiere date of the HBO series “Crashing.” It is Sunday, not Saturday.

 At least 242 people have been killed in Mozambique, 139 people in Zimbabwe and 56 people in Malawi, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Aid organizations said those figures could rise drastically as rescuers reach previously inaccessible areas.
</p>
<p class="g-body">
 The floodwaters from the cyclone, called Idai, could have reached almost 20 feet deep, according to Matthew Cochrane, a spokesman for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.

</p>
<p class="g-body">
 The storm made landfall about two weeks ago near Quelimane, a city about 190 miles northeast of Beira, as a tropical depression with torrential rain. Wind speeds were only around 40 miles per hour, and after a few days, the storm changed course and moved back into the ocean.

 Over the past week, the storm rapidly strengthened — wind speeds picked up to about 70 miles per hour as the storm headed back in the direction of Mozambique.
</p>
<p class="g-body">
 On Thursday night, the cyclone struck Mozambique for a second time. This time, however, the storm barreled toward Beira, Mozambique’s fourth-largest city, with winds over 100 miles per hour and more than seven inches of rain. The storm moved inland, devastating parts of Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe.
</p>
<p class="g-body">
 Imagery of Beira provided by the International Federation of Red Cross showed the extent of the damage in the city’s center on Friday.
</p>
<p class="g-body">
 The storm destroyed “90 percent” of Beira, a city of about a half-million people, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said on Monday.
</p>
<p class="g-body">
 Aerial footage showed people huddled on dry areas, waiting to be rescued. Mr. Nyusi said that overflowing rivers had submerged villages and isolated communities. He reported seeing floating bodies.

 BURNLEY, England, — Chris Wood scored twice as Burnley virtually assured Premier League safety with a 2-0 win over fellow strugglers Cardiff City on Saturday which left the Welsh club deep in relegation trouble and their manager Neil Warnock fuming.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Cardiff, occupying the final relegation slot in 18th place, are on 28 points, five behind 17th-placed Brighton with five games remaining. Burnley, who have won three in a row, move up to 14th place on 39 points -- 11 ahead of Cardiff.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But for the large travelling Welsh support the game will be remembered for a second half penalty incident when, with the score at 1-0 to Burnley, referee Mike Dean changed his mind after initially pointing to the spot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 New Zealander Wood, who had struck the post in the second minute, put the Clarets in front in the 31st minute with a fine header from a Dwight McNeil corner.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Burnley then had several chances to add to their lead with Cardiff keeper Neil Etheridge twice doing well to keep out shots from Clarets midfielder Ashley Westwood.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Just before the break, Burnley's Ashley Barnes was booked after a confrontation with Joe Bennett where he appeared to kiss the Cardiff defender on the nose.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Cardiff came out strongly after the interval and thought they had a great chance to level three minutes into the second half when they were initially awarded a penalty for a handball by Ben Mee.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The linesman's flag was raised after Mee headed the ball at his own hand and Dean responded by pointing to the spot.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But after consulting with his assistant Darren Cann, Dean changed his mind, leading to angry protests from the Cardiff players and sighs of relief from the home crowd.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "Mike must have seen something to go over and we're gutted really. I think Darren made the right decision and Mike has talked him out of it," said Warnock.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Junior Hoilett then wasted a great chance for Cardiff, blasting high over the bar after being found unmarked inside the area.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Burnley made sure of the win in stoppage time when Wood added his second goal, nodding home from close range after a winding run from winger McNeil whose low cross was clipped into the air by the sliding Bruno Manga.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The win means Burnley could be mathematically safe before their next game at Chelsea on Easter Monday but manager Sean Dyche was wary of assuming survival was now guaranteed.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "I don't think you talk about that because you want it factually. You can't guarantee it but I think we're in a very, very healthy position," he said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Warnock's side now play Brighton, who on Saturday suffered a 5-0 thrashing at home to Bournemouth, on Tuesday in a match which looks like the last chance for them to find a path away from the drop.

 The Japanese soufflé pancake seems to
 <!-- -->
 defy pastry physics:
 <!-- -->
 An airy vanilla batter is cooked in a pan, which leaves it lightly toasted on each side and cloudlike in the center. As wobbly as fresh silken tofu and served in tall stacks, each cake manages to maintain its structure, even after it’s dressed with toppings like matcha custard sauce, chewy boba pearls, fresh berries or cascades of maple syrup and melted butter.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The pancakes are a fast-growing food trend on Instagram, where nearly 50,000 photos are tagged
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/soufflepancake/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  #soufflepancake
 </a>
 . In addition to their attractive, springy texture and sweet, colorful toppings, there seems to be a third factor in their social media success: a long line. For the food-obsessed, a line can be like catnip. They want to taste what’s at the end of it, and posting a photo of the experience is proof that they did.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “People love to line up,” said Karen Li Lo, one of the owners of Motto Tea Cafe in Pasadena, Calif., where soufflé pancakes are on the menu. “They like feeling like they are a part of something more.” Today, lines for pancakes can be found across the United States, and in London, where the wait for an order at the new cafe Fuwa Fuwa has been compared to purgatory.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Their origin story is the subject of some
 <!-- -->
 speculation.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “I’ve heard they’re inspired by ‘
 <!-- -->
 Crayon Shin-chan
 <!-- -->
 ,’ the Japanese cartoon,” says Sakura Yagi, the
 <!-- -->
 chief operating officer
 <!-- -->
 of T.I.C.
 <!-- -->
 Restaurant Group
 <!-- -->
 , which owns
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/dining/hi-collar-japanese-restaurant.html?module=inline" title="">
  the Japanese coffeehouse Hi-Collar
 </a>
 in the East Village. Shin-chan, a manga and anime character known for his precocious nature and mischievous humor, was popular in the 1990s. He’s a small child, but slightly plump “and jiggly,” Ms. Yagi said with a laugh, “like a soufflé pancake.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Hi-Collar started serving its pancakes six years ago, and Ms. Yagi likes to say they’re more of “a precursor” to the soufflé pancake. An eggy, highly aerated batter is rested, then cooked in one-inch-high ring molds on an electric griddle, which yields an exceptionally tall and fluffy mini-cake that, when poked with a fork, reacts like a small, round Tempur-Pedic mattress.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 2014, two shops in Osaka, Japan —
 <!-- -->
 Shiawase no Pancake
 <!-- -->
 (translated into English as a Happy Pancake) and Gram Cafe — started selling soufflé pancakes. Both cafes eventually opened outposts in Tokyo, and by 2016 their bouncy pancakes were all over Instagram. Today,

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">

 , develop a pillowy or puffy texture.
 <!-- -->
 But soufflé pancakes reach greater heights because they’re made from a meringue-based batter. The eggs in the recipe are separated. The yolks are mixed with flour, milk and sometimes a leavening agent like baking powder, while the whites and sugar are beaten into a stiff meringue.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Folded together and scooped into ring molds on a frying pan (or sometimes right onto a griddle, without the ring), they stand nearly as tall and wide as a softball, and have a marshmallowlike texture because they’re cooked at a low temperature for a relatively long amount of time.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Ideally we want them to be at least two inches tall,” said Ms. Lo, who owns Motto Tea Cafe with
 <!-- -->
 Johnny Li
 <!-- -->
 , her
 <!-- -->
 brother
 <!-- -->
 .
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. Li, who used to live in Tokyo and still visits several times a year (“I guess you can say I am obsessed with Japan,” he said), first heard of the pancakes about five years ago, and knew he wanted to bring them to Los Angeles.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ms. Lo developed her recipe based on the pancakes she tasted in Tokyo. But when Motto opened in 2018, sh
 <!-- -->
 e said, “a lot of people were confused
 <!-- -->
 .” They didn’t want pancakes in the afternoon, and they certainly didn’t expect to wait a long time for a dish that, at a diner or at home, takes only a few minutes to cook.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “In Japan, people eat pancakes all day, not just in the morning,” Mr. Li said. “They’re like a snack — not breakfast.” Customers who were unfamiliar with the concept were frustrated when their order took 15 minutes to make.
 <!-- -->
 (That time is necessary for the pancake to cook all the way through.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 At Taiyaki in Chinatown in Manhattan, customers
 <!-- -->
 have complained
 <!-- -->
 about the wait, which can average over an hour, leading the shop’s owners to limit pancake availability to weekends only. Some commenters on the shop’s Instagram posts beg Taiyaki’s owners to open outposts in their cities, including Austin and Miami, while others tag friends, asking them to be “pancake buddies” and wait in line together.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And yet,
 <!-- -->
 according to Ms. Lo, the Japanese have moved on: The soufflé pancake is just not that
 <!-- -->
 big in Japan.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “They’re more into regular pancakes now,” she said.

</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Seven years ago, Tacko Fall and Christ Koumadje were discovered by basketball scouts in a similar fashion.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 They were hard to miss.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 On the streets of Dakar, Senegal, the two 7-footers stood out. They were spotted by employees of the Flying Star Academy, a Senegalese training ground for several basketball players who have ended up on college teams in the United States. The employees chased after the teenagers, imploring them to try their enormous hands at the sport.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/sports/ncaa-tournament-highlights.html?module=inline" title="">
  [Follow our live coverage of the N.C.A.A. tournament here.]
 </a>
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 At the time, Koumadje, now a 7-foot-4 senior at Florida State, preferred soccer. Fall, now a 7-foot-6 senior at Central Florida, was more interested in devouring anime and manga series like “Naruto” and “Tokyo Ghoul.” Both were, at first, indifferent to basketball.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But their potential upside was difficult to ignore. To onlookers, they evoked thoughts of the next Hakeem Olajuwon or Yao Ming.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Today, their size offers less promise. They toiled to become giant forces in the paint, only to watch as basketball evolved from a game that coveted height into a more freewheeling, 3-point-centric game that deems their skill sets nearly as obsolete as a fax machine: nice to have, but no longer entirely necessary.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “What’s interesting about both, their advanced analytics, they play off the charts — well over 1 point per possession, and that’s really effective in college basketball,” said Steve Kyler, the editor and publisher of
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.basketballinsiders.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Basketball Insiders
 </a>
 , which produces weekly N.B.A. mock drafts. “When you dig deeper, in situational-type things they grade really well, but the truth of the matter is the N.B.A. game isn’t played that way anymore. It’s all about stretch 5s, quickness.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “I think they may get a look on the fringe based off their size,” Kyler added. “But a guy 7-foot-6 being the first overall pick or top five is pretty rare now.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In the college game, where height can still create a tangible advantage, Fall and Koumadje — who are among the tallest players currently in Division I — will be crucial cogs in their teams’ N.C.A.A. tournament performance.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Beyond that, whether they can find a place and purpose in the N.B.A. — where the only active players who stand 7-foot-3 or taller are Dallas’s Kristaps Porzingis, who has a far more diverse skill set, and Philadelphia’s Boban Marjanovic — remains to be seen.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Extending my range is something I definitely want to work on,” said Fall, who helped the Knights earn their first N.C.A.A. tournament berth since 2005 by averaging nearly 11 points and 7 rebounds a game. “I’m not going to go out there and shoot 3s like a lot of bigs do now, but pick my spots.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “But I feel like no matter how the game has changed, you still need somebody down low to do some damage.”

 . After playing for a few months at the academy, Fall got a chance to join a high school team in the United States. His mother reluctantly let her son go, hoping he would receive a better education.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Extremely raw when he arrived at Liberty Christian Preparatory School in Tavares, Fla., Fall almost quit basketball. But he refined his game while playing on a travel team alongside Ben Simmons, now with the Philadelphia 76ers. Fall also trained in Houston with Olajuwon, a Hall of Famer who emphasized the importance of footwork for a center his size.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Occasionally, Fall watched Simmons at nearby Montverde Academy, where Koumadje landed after coming to the United States. Fall and Koumadje only briefly overlapped in Dakar — Koumadje is originally from Chad — but in high school they talked on the phone or via Facebook. Their discussions rarely veered into basketball. Instead, they commiserated about the difficulties of adjusting to life when you are over 7 feet tall and 4,500 miles from home.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Koumadje, like Fall, grasps the unlikelihood that he will develop into a free-shooting N.B.A. big man. Before his senior year in high school, he played pickup games at the University of Southern California with Andre Drummond of the Detroit Pistons. It was then, Koumadje said, that he realized he was more effective cemented in the post.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “The game is evolving and that’s what people want,” said Koumadje, a two-year starter who led the Seminoles in blocked shots this season. “But I play to my strength. That’s what I do.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Fall’s turning point came after his sophomore season at Central Florida, when he contemplated entering the 2017 N.B.A. draft. Five teams told him he needed vast improvement adapting to the speed of the pros, particularly in guarding pick-and-rolls.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Central Florida Coach Johnny Dawkins — a former Duke guard who played with the towering centers Shawn Bradley and Manute Bol in the N.B.A. — was hired before Fall’s sophomore year, and created a three-year plan for him. Increasing mobility and stamina came first, followed by catching the ball down low and learning to work out of double and triple teams. This season, Dawkins has moved Fall farther out on the perimeter defensively.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Wherever he stands, Fall often forces opposing players to elevate more when they shoot, to get the ball over his arms.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Our floaters have to be a little bit higher, and it probably screwed a couple of guys up,” Fran Dunphy, Temple’s coach at the time, said after a game against Central Florida on March 9.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Teams have tried less inventive strategies to bypass Fall’s 8-foot-4 wingspan. Fall, who is bulkier than Bol or Bradley, said that he had heard opposing coaches tell players to go after his knees.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Though he is all but assured of breaking the Division I record for career field-goal percentage — he currently shoots
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/leaders/fg-pct-player-career.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  over 74 percent
 </a>
 ; the record is 67.8 — Fall converts only 36 percent of his free throws. Fall — whose hands are 10½ inches long — said that when he shoots free throws it feels as if he is holding a volleyball.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/TheHoopCentral/status/1082386049135857669" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  His shooting form
 </a>
 , which involves using only his right hand while flinging his left arm in the air and then slouching, has drawn derisive comments on social media, where he is sometimes treated as a sideshow. After Fall had 13 points and 10 rebounds in a win over Houston that ended the Cougars' 33-game home winning streak, Fall got more attention for a GIF that showed him
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://streamable.com/j47m0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  holding the ball over an opponent’s head
 </a>
 like an older brother playing keep-away.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Fall and Koumadje are accustomed to stares in airports and snide remarks from opposing fans. While both harbor N.B.A. dreams — neither appears in most mock drafts — they also envision a life beyond basketball, when their height won’t dictate how others perceive them.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Koumadje said he would eventually like to work for the United Nations, helping refugees in Chad. Fall wants to become an engineer.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Basketball’s opened a lot of doors for me, but there’s more to me than the ball, the hoop,” Fall said. “I definitely don’t want to be defined by that. I definitely don’t want to be seen as an attraction, either.”

 Along with “Astro Boy” and “Speed Racer,” the 1960s live-action superhero series “Ultraman” was one of the first Japanese TV programs to reach a mainstream audience worldwide. In its homeland, this tale of a gigantic armored alien and his symbiotic human companion has inspired sequels and spinoffs galore, including a current manga series that follows the adventures of the original hero’s son. That comic has been adapted to this new animated TV series, which blends traditional anime techniques with CGI.

The first episode begins with the serial killer gunning down the fashion designer, and then hour by hour “The Assassination of Gianni Versace” moves backward in the timeline, investigating how both these men were shaped by their family lives, by their egos and by the underground nature of gay culture in the late 20th century.

 The special Christmas episode of “Chilling Adventures of Sabrina” that arrived in mid-December of 2018 offered a brief respite in the ongoing saga of the well-meaning teenage witch, Sabrina Spellman (played by Kiernan Shipka). But as part two of the series’ first season begins, the heroine finds herself back in a mess of her own making. She’s tapped into demonic powers to help her friends, and is now having trouble keeping her darker impulses in check. As with the season’s first half, expect story lines that evoke Harry Potter and “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” with an eerily beautiful visual style that resembles “Rosemary’s Baby” and Hammer horror films.

 ” developed a small but fervent fan following over the course of its five seasons, telling strange, sardonic stories about how society might adjust to a zombie apocalypse. The prequel spinoff “Black Summer” circles back to the beginning of the outbreak, following a mother (played by Jaime King) who’s trying to find her way to her daughter, dodging the undead while forging relationships with other survivors who’ve been left behind. The new show is being pitched as a more traditional thriller, replacing wry humor with white-knuckle chases and narrow escapes.

 The Netflix series “Chef’s Table” sets a new standard for how TV shows about cooking could look and feel, bringing psychological depth and visual lyricism to the subject of food. Some of the “Chef’s Table” creative team will now take that same approach to the world’s street vendors in “Street Food,” a series focusing on the culture of entire cities and countries — including Singapore and India, in season one — rather than on the habits and obsessions of individual chefs.

 The rebooted version of the clunky ‘80s syndicated cartoon “She-Ra: Princess of Power” was one of 2018’s most pleasant TV surprises: a fusion of the original’s old-fashioned science-fiction/fantasy mythology with the cultural diversity, emotional richness and character-driven storytelling of more modern animated series. Even the name was changed, to reflect a premise that surrounds the title heroine with multiple magical warriors. Having introduced a teeming cast of complicated heroes and villains in season one, the series’ creator Noelle Stevenson and her staff of writers and illustrators will in year two be looking to put them into action in stories with more epic sweep.

 Brie Larson is having a stellar 2019 so far, first starring in the international box-office smash “Captain Marvel,” and now seeing her 2017 directorial debut “Unicorn Store” finally get distribution via Netflix. Written by Samantha McIntyre, “Unicorn Store” stars Larson as Kit, an aimless, artsy young woman, who’s just about to settle for a dull-but-stable life in a corporate cubicle when she gets an offer from a mysterious stranger (played by Samuel L. Jackson), who says he can sell her a unicorn. The film’s quirkily colorful images are in service of a whimsical story, meant to raise questions about what it means — realistically — to “follow your dream.”

 After directing some of the best-loved comedies of the 21st century — including “Anchorman,” “Talladega Nights” and “Step Brothers” — Adam McKay tried something different with 2015’s “The Big Short,” an adaptation of Michael Lewis’ nonfiction book about the 2008 financial crisis. An all-star cast that includes Brad Pitt, Ryan Gosling, Steve Carell and an Oscar-nominated Christian Bale help McKay and his fellow screenwriter Charles Randolph tell a complicated story about the people who predicted the market crash, and who made a lot of money thanks to flaws in the system. This is a lively, frequently funny movie, with a point to make about how everyday folks are often lied to and betrayed by politicians and pundits.

 The loud-voiced comic Tim Robinson is probably best-known for cocreating and co-starring in the sweetly eccentric sitcom “Detroiters,” with his friend Sam Richardson. But he also spent a few years as a writer and an occasional bit player on “Saturday Night Live.” Robinson puts that sketch training to use — along with his ability to make a strong, not always positive first impression — in the offbeat cringe-comedy show “I Think You Should Leave.” In a variety of scenarios, Robinson and others play characters so obnoxious and intense that they drive anyone in the immediate vicinity into fleeing.

 Some poets are cutters, others are curers, showing up to every occasion like a condolence-wisher with a casserole. Chelsey Minnis is firmly in the first category. Her verse arrives well chilled. It is served with misanthropic aplomb.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Let’s go get some smoke in our eyes,” she writes in her latest collection, “Baby, I Don’t Care,” a set of nearly 150 single-page poems, most of them untitled double quintets, that play with notions taken from Hollywood’s golden era and film noir.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “I love to go to bed sober, / which means I have to start drinking early,” her narrator comments. “I like it when two men take off their dinner jackets and fight,” she says. “Next time you see me, I’ll be crashing Rolls-Royces.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Minnis is endlessly quotable, so one has to work hard not to quote her endlessly. “Let’s be objectionable and immoral and utterly no good,” her narrator suggests. “Let’s get thrown into third class.” She says: “You see, I’m the type of person who would hurt a fly.” And: “Did anyone ever try to kill you in a rowboat before?”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In “Baby, I Don’t Care,” one of the most unusual and persuasive books of poems I’ve read in some time, Minnis is not merely conducting a droll séance with the help of Turner Classic Movies. (She thanks TCM in her acknowledgments.)
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 As anyone who is familiar with her four earlier collections is aware, she’s a provocative thinker about gender and poetry and the erotics of dislike. As she wrote in “Poemland,” her 2009 collection, “Sometimes I try to please someone that I hate … / So that I can enjoy a range of satisfactions.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Her poems marinate in the sort of feelings you don’t like to admit you have. There’s a tang of Nietzsche in her antisocial desires, her amorality. Minnis is a bored, fierce, literate attendee at what the poet Frederick Seidel has referred to as “life’s cotillion.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The speaker in “Baby, I Don’t Care” is a soignée gold-digger (“Baby, why don’t you give me an oil well or something?”) who toys with the lunk who keeps her in diamonds.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He’s a side of beef into which she flicks verbal darts. “Baby, it’s so sexy to think. / Why don’t you try it?” she says. And: “Try not to talk when you’re sober, darling.” She coos, “You’re so handsome it’s a shame. / It makes me want to murder some pigeons.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Like a pickpocket, without belaboring any of her points, Minnis unpacks and satirizes the misogyny embedded in this relationship.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Minnis was born in 1970. She grew up in Denver and attended the University of Colorado in Boulder and the Iowa Writers’ Workshop. At Boulder, she studied under the poet Edward Dorn. In her 2007 book, “Bad Bad,” she wrote: “The poet I worship is Edward Dorn, because I adore his disgust.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Her first book, “Zirconia,” appeared in 2001. In much of her early work, the poems comprise clusters of words that float in fields of ellipses, to intense if slippery effect. These ellipses function like cosmic versions of Emily Dickinson’s dashes. At times, in ways both comic and deadly earnest, Minnis can seem like Dickinson broadcasting from hell.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 With “Baby, I Don’t Care” in bookstores, and “Zirconia” and “Bad Bad” about to be
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.fenceportal.org/book/zirconia-bad-bad/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  reissued in one volume
 </a>
 from Fence Books, Minnis, one senses, may be about to have a moment. The gifted poet Sandra Simonds recently wrote
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/articles/149556/riot-girl" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  a bracing analysis of Minnis’s work
 </a>
 on the Poetry Foundation’s website.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Minnis’s poems are unrhymed yet aphoristic and diligently organized. In her direct access to pain and sometimes wit, her knack for absurdity and disturbance, she can resemble poets as diverse as Anne Sexton and Patricia Lockwood. She combines glamour and ordure in a manner that can resemble the prose of Ottessa Moshfegh.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 She understands recrimination and revenge. Reading her might make you recall Graham Greene’s line about Flann O’Brien’s novel “At Swim-Two-Birds,” the way it filled him with “the kind of glee one experiences when people smash china on the stage.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Minnis writes frequently about poetry itself. In “Bad Bad,” there is a section that reads like a dissident manifesto. There are many jokers in Minnis’s pack. Sometimes the only way to talk about this poet is to let her talk, so I am going to print some unconnected observations from “Bad Bad” and get out of the way.
</p>
<p class="css-1plcdrk evys1bk0">
 People say “nothing new” or “the death of the author” but, I am new and I am not dead.
</p>
<p class="css-1plcdrk evys1bk0">
 If anyone thinks they need to write reviews, teach classes, edit magazines, or translate books in order to write good poetry … then maybe they should just take a rest from it.
</p><p class="css-1plcdrk evys1bk0">
 Poetry is for crap since there’s no money or fast cars in it …
 <br/>
 But, in the thighs … I feel it.
</p>
<p class="css-1plcdrk evys1bk0">
 You should not fall in love with your mentor, but you should try to punish him with your poems.
</p>
<p class="css-1plcdrk evys1bk0">
 I fell in love with my mentor like a novice …
 <br/>
 I was a nude girl on a fire truck ringing a bell.
</p>
<p class="css-1plcdrk evys1bk0">
 I cannot write poems to honor other poets …
 <br/>
 I do not think of them at all.
</p>
<p class="css-1plcdrk evys1bk0">
 I am only sentimental about my drinks …
</p>
<p class="css-1plcdrk evys1bk0">
 I will tell you what is poetry …
 <br/>
 It is a remote electronic claw picking up a stuffed bunny rabbit …
</p>
<p class="css-1plcdrk evys1bk0">
 It is like bleeding from your anus in the snow.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Even better, Minnis may not be glad of this review. In the same collection, she writes: “I want to write a poem because I don’t feel very boring! / But I will feel like a stuffed leopard because of the praise.” In her new book, she writes: “Let me give you my feedback. / My feedback is arf arf arf.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Let’s say you haven’t bought a book of poetry in some time. “Baby, I Don’t Care” and the reissues from Fence Books could make you come back. You could start here.

 But “Captain Marvel” is not the only recent female-led film in the comic or sci-fi realm to be swarmed by trolls. As my colleague Cara Buckley
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/movies/captain-marvel-brie-larson-rotten-tomatoes.html?module=inline" title="">
  wrote this week
 </a>
 : “The all-female remake of ‘Ghostbusters,’ ‘Black Panther’ and ‘Star Wars: The Last Jedi,’ which had a diverse cast, all found themselves in the cross hairs of armchair critics, some aligned with alt-right groups.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Last year, a Facebook group called “Down with Disney’s Treatment of Franchises and Its Fanboys” posted an event called “Give Black Panther a Rotten Audience Score on Rotten Tomatoes.” The group had also
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2305232/person-who-says-they-rigged-the-last-jedis-rotten-tomatoes-score-is-trying-to-do-the-same-with-black-panther" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  claimed responsibility
 </a>
 for sinking scores for “Star Wars: The Last Jedi.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Those who appeared to have targeted “Captain Marvel” were most likely incited by comments made by Brie Larson, the titular star. Last year, Larson vowed to seek out more underrepresented journalists after noticing she was being interviewed by mostly white men. She had a similar critique about film critics: “I do not need a 40-year-old white dude to tell me what didn’t work for him about ‘A Wrinkle in Time.’ It wasn’t made for him.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 She also told “

 In her top hat and tuxedo, Gladys Bentley belted gender-bending original blues numbers and lewd parodies of popular songs, eventually becoming 1920s Harlem royalty. When not accompanied by a dazzling piano, the singer often swept through the audience, flirting with women and soliciting dirty lyrics from them as she sang.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 By the early 1930s, Bentley was Harlem’s most famous lesbian figure and among the best-known black entertainers in the U.S. She was also the first prominent performer of her era to embrace a transgender identity.

  I CAN ONLY DRAW WORMS

 Written and illustrated by Will Mabbitt.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Maybe Mabbitt can’t draw many things, but boy, can he conceive and execute a witty, surprising, maximum fun picture book. Oh, and this one doubles as a counting exercise. Having announced that worms are his entire repertoire, Mabbitt proceeds to wrangle 10 neon-bright ones onto the pages, with hilarious difficulty. They’re so hard to tell apart. And poor worm No. 8: “It’s not true that if a worm is cut in half it makes two worms,” we learn. “It makes two half worms.”

  THE SUN SHINES EVERYWHERE
 </strong>
 <br/>
 Written by Mary Ann Hoberman.
 <br/>
 Illustrated by Luciano Lozano.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 If you’re as picky about rhyming picture books as I am, you’ll be excited that the former children’s poet laureate Hoberman, whose meter never falters, has created this clever ode to the sun and its globe-spanning, life-giving power. With Lozano’s cheerful art, the pages fly by, dropping tidbits of geoscience and empathy-building name-checks of far-off places: “Some children live in Paris / And others live in Rome. / Some children dwell in New Rochelle / And some call China home.” (But why no mention of Africans?)

  MOST MARSHMALLOWS
 </strong>
 <br/>
 Written and illustrated by Rowboat Watkins.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Can marshmallows be exquisite? That’s the word that leaps to mind for this new picture book from Watkins (“Rude Cakes,” “Big Bunny”), which is full of irresistible handmade figures and precisely detailed diorama art. With their delicately penciled-on faces and outfits, the marshmallows in this world are everyday folks: “They go to school most mornings / and learn to be squishy / and how to stand in rows,” and they live in houses and celebrate birthdays. Like all Watkins’s books, this one has wonderfully compact language and an ending that surprises, with a rousing, wholehearted imaginative leap. It turns out even humble marshmallows can — and should — dream big.

  A STORY THAT GROWS

 Written and illustrated by Gilles Bachelet.

 This nifty bedtime book from the esteemed French illustrator Bachelet has a parent-child pair of creatures on every spread. Each kid is in a species-specific crib, ready to hear a story that takes off in an appropriate direction: The ostrich’s story “hatches,” the snail’s story “takes … its … time.” The creatures, who include a truck and a Martian, are not named — this book asks for, and will reward, intense visual reading from young listeners, as they pore over the gorgeous, kooky bedrooms, filled with hilarious customized beds and toys.

 Elliot’s funny story is told in animal sounds and onomatopoeia (“Mooo!” and “Boing!”). One by one, unruly animals join a pig in his bathtub. Pig looks distraught, then angry, until he creates a tub-clearing moment (think unidentified bubbles) and enjoys his bath in peace. The delicacy and subtlety of the art only adds to the frisky humor.

 The little acorn-capped creatures in Brosgol’s (“Leave Me Alone!”) latest gem think they’re “the strongest guys in the whole forest” — there are so many of them, after all. Marching and climbing together, they try to dominate bigger animals. As they try to yank a berry from a baby bird’s mouth, they crash to earth. Chastened, they climb back up to feed the whole nest. What a fantastic message: not just “teamwork,” but actual community.

 There isn’t a single pickup truck in “Lot,” Bryan Washington’s first book of stories. The setting is Houston, but oil is barely mentioned. The Bush family and the space industry don’t come up at all. No one tells anyone to go big or go home (an unofficial state slogan). But because many of Washington’s characters are recent immigrants, that imperative is more or less implied.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Washington’s subtle, dynamic and flexible stories play out across the city’s sprawling and multiethnic neighborhoods. His characters move through streets named so often — Richmond and Waugh, Rusk and Fairview — that they come to have talismanic power, like the street names in Springsteen songs.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Washington’s stories, like Philip Levine’s poems, are heavily peopled. “Gonzalo belched it and Neesha sang it and Marilyn prayed for a flash of intuition” is a not untypical sentence. One story gives us a frightened crew of gay hustlers, many of them boys, named Scratch and Google and Poke and Knock and Nacho.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 There’s a zigzag through line in “Lot.” About half of the stories are about a single family. In particular they’re about the coming-of-age of a teenager, the son of a black mother and a Latino father, who works in the family restaurant and is discovering, to the delight of his shivering senses, that he likes to fool around with boys.

 </em>
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Other stories loop around this boy’s tale. One is about how a woman’s affair with a “whiteboy” rattles an entire apartment building. “When she came around looking for ackee,” Washington writes, slyly, “his was the freshest on the shelf.” Another is a caper about two amiable numbskulls who work at a restaurant called the Sushi Shack. They find what they call a chupacabra under a bridge, and hope their photos of the poor animal will go viral. Others are about drug dealers, the members of a baseball team and hurricane survivors.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The first thing to say about Washington is that he’s an alert and often comic observer of the world. “Denise lived in one of those walk-ups that look like garbage from a distance,” he writes. “Then you get a little closer and they don’t look any better.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He has a gift for observing things like skin tones. The central character’s father “wore his skin like a sunburnt peach.” His mother has a darker pigment, “like rust on the rim of the stove.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He places the casual racism of the food industry on display. When the boy goes out looking for work in restaurants besides his family’s, “They read my name and they saw my face and they pointed to the dishes.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 At the same time, Washington’s writing about food has a resonant matter-of-factness. “I slice and I marinate and unsleeve the meat,” the young man says. “Pack it in aluminum. Load the pit, light the fire. The pigs we gut have blue eyes. They start blinking when you do it, like they’re having flashbacks.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 There’s nothing overtly or pretentiously literary about his stories, but when books are mentioned you tend to want to visit the passages twice. Here he is on a young woman, a sometime prostitute, and her bookishness:
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “She hit the resorts; she discovered Milton; she worked the coast; she discovered Rimbaud; she bought some heels; she discovered Babel; she took care of her skin; she discovered Rumi; she tried not to catch the clap; she discovered Borges; she caught the clap; she discovered Allende; she waited it out; she discovered Plath; she tried not to catch anything else.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Washington cracks open a vibrant, polyglot side of Houston about which few outsiders are aware. On one level, this landscape is bleak. These stories take place amid dismal laundromats and broken-down pharmacies. There are turf wars and shootouts. Things happen near Dollar Tree stores or in Whataburger parking lots. The men and women here are extended hope only in minuscule, homeopathic amounts. Perversely, their neighborhoods are gentrifying at the same time, pricing many long-timers out.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But there is a fair amount of joy in Washington’s stories, too. (Some have previously appeared in magazines like Tin House and The New Yorker.) An underthrob of emotion beats inside them. He’s confident enough not to force the action. The stories feel loose, their cellular juices free to flow.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Living in what the critic Albert Murray called “this great hit-and-miss republic,” Washington’s characters pivot between alienation and longing. Many of them lack papers or have expiring visas or worry about getting deported over a traffic ticket.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “I haven’t seen the stars since I made it to Houston,” one recent immigrant says. She feels the city’s smog in her throat. She wants to learn not just English but “
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  English
 </em>
 english, the language of money,” the kind she hears in banks.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 These newcomers are mostly welcome. As one character remarks, “With our not-legals shuffling in, people who don’t have time for the violence, people whose only reason for bouncing was to get
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  away
 </em>
 from the violence, we’ve mellowed out, found our rhythm. Slowed down. You can raise a kid in the complex. Start a garden.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 A few of these stories are barely more than vignettes. One or two don’t quite coalesce. This is on a certain level a modest book, one that isn’t going to drive other young short story writers into the shadows. But the promise Washington displays is real and large.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 One of the moving things about “Lot” is its communal sensibility. There’s a sense that these characters are all in it together, and the narrators have a way of gliding between “I” and “we.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 One of them tries to remember “a time when you could probably look at the four of us and still call us okay.”

 At one point in “Alita: Battle Angel” — another dystopian fantasy that reminds you of just how visionary the original “Blade Runner” was — the cyborg heroine gets a new body. It’s a streamlined shoulder-to-foot job, one that makes her look like a sex doll with a chrome-plated musculoskeletal system. Her new physique turns out to be an innovative weapon and comes with articulated parts, a wasp waist and what looks like a discreet chastity panel for the groin. It also has larger breasts than the old model, a change that in a snort-out-loud line is pinned on Alita’s own ideas about how she should look.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 If only someone here were joking or had an idea about the construction of femininity. Why does Alita (Rosa Salazar), who has a human brain, even have breasts? Why does any cyborg that isn’t a sex bot or a wet nurse? Genre convention only partly explains the onscreen look of this character, originally created by Yukito Kishiro in his manga series. Kishiro sexes up his cyborg, an amnesiac who in the first comic retains one protuberant breast when the rest of her body is destroyed. This brings to mind Jessica Rabbit, the bodacious femme fatale in “Who Framed Roger Rabbit” who purrs “I’m just drawn that way” — yeah, but by whom, for whom and why?
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Alita” is the latest from James Cameron, though he takes only some of the blame. He helped produce the movie and shares script credit with Laeta Kalogridis (they collaborated on “Avatar”); he was going to direct it himself but handed it off to Robert Rodriguez (“Sin City”). The presence of other “Avatar” veterans — the senior visual effects supervisor, animation supervisor and so on — raised expectations that “Alita” would at least look good, different or inspired. But too much of its overall design feels borrowed, by turns evoking the monochromatic clutter of “District 9,” the vertical favelas of “Ready Player One” and the randomly milling, anonymous hordes of whatever.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 A pileup of clichés in service to technological whiz-bangery, “Alita” is one more story of the not quite human brought to life with hubris and bleeding-edge science. It takes place in the 23rd century after a global cataclysm called the Fall. The movie’s story, inspirations and allusions (
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.tcm.com/mediaroom/video/224654/Saboteur-Movie-Clip-Hurry-Up-With-The-Rope-.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="watch it!">
  Hitchcock!
 </a>
 ), though, more rightly announce it as a 20th-century artifact, one that begins when Alita’s head and shoulders are found and refurbished by a paternalistic doctor, Ido (an atypically uneasy Christoph Waltz). Theirs is a post-apocalyptic meet-cute that morphs from yet another riff on Frankenstein’s monster into a sitcom-y father-and-daughter duet, plus brawling and exposition.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The story proceeds by fits and starts with a narrative line — Alita’s journey of self-awareness — that is embellished with a dreary old-fashioned romance and regularly interrupted by chaotic action scenes. Some of this crash-boom stuff takes place during a game called Motorball, one of those survivalist contests that have been a genre staple since at least the
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GEKV1dOgY" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  1975 film “Death Race 2000.”
 </a>
 The contestants have something to do with Vector (a wasted Mahershala Ali), a regulation villain who takes fashion cues from “The Matrix.” This being a very small world, he lives with Ido’s ex, Chiren (Jennifer Connelly), who when not selling her soul lounges in garters and stockings.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Everything here tends to remind you of something else, including Alita, who was created with performance capture. This involves monitoring and recording a performer’s movements using sensors attached to her face and body, information that becomes the foundation for a character that’s digitally fleshed out. Cameron used a version of this technology to greater effect in “Avatar,” a reminder that whatever his limitations as a filmmaker — he’s a great visual storyteller who’s invariably easier on the eyes than ears — he is a technological wiz. Salazar’s performance, alas, is consistently bland, but then she was drawn and directed that way, like Jessica Rabbit.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s easy to imagine that both Salazar and Rodriguez would have fared better if her face had been left alone rather than rendered into a stylized manga cartoon, complete with a heart shape and eyes even bigger than Emma Stone’s. It’s vaguely diverting to stare at Alita’s face, at least at first, to ponder its shape, texture and pale color, and the way that her brow furrows when she’s being emphatic. Mostly, though, what’s interesting about it is that it lacks the conviction, the spark, which turns truly wonderful animated creations — Disney’s Pinocchio,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/14/movies/14ponyo.html?module=inline" title="">
  Hayao Miyazaki’s Ponyo
 </a>
 — into characters you laugh with and weep for. This is a matter of style, inspiration and imagination, or their absence.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 There’s so little at stake in “Alita: Battle Angel” that it blurs into uninvolving spasms of visual and aural noise as it lurches to the cliffhanger ending, a setup for promised sequels. If you stick around for the end credits, you will read that “the making and authorized distribution of this film supported over 15,000 jobs and involved hundreds of thousands of work hours.” In other words, piracy threatens the American movie industry, even if a chunk of the jobs here seem to have originated outside the United States. It’s still a worthy wag of the finger, although it’s difficult not to wish that more of those hours had been spent telling a really good story instead of tweaking tech and shiny breasts.

 How do you judge the performance of a very expensive cyborg?
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 On one hand, Fox’s “Alita: Battle Angel,” an effects-laden, dystopian, sci-fi action movie with a bionic heroine, easily topped this weekend’s domestic box office. It exceeded most analysts’ expectations by bringing in about $27.8 million in the lead-up to Presidents’ Day.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 On the other hand, that amount is modest next to the roughly $170 million it took make the movie, produced in part by James Cameron and based on a manga series by Yukito Kishiro. A digitally augmented Rosa Salazar leads a cast that also includes Christoph Waltz and Mahershala Ali.

 , opening to about $7.5 million domestically against a budget of around $100 million. Fox had initially planned to release “Alita: Battle Angel” in December, when it would have gone up against a tangle of holiday crowd-pleasers. The studio’s decision to push the release to February seems to have helped Cameron to avoid, at least, a “Mortal Engines”-like disaster.

  SUNDAY PUZZLE —
 </a>
 Today’s Erik Agard grid has a little trick, one of those breezy ones that you figure out and start thinking, “Oh, I bet I could come up with dozens of these” (you probably can’t). There’s a Will Shortz introduction to the Sunday grid in print now, for anyone who doesn’t read the paper Sunday Magazine, and apparently Mr. Agard does a Sunday puzzle in around five minutes. I felt as if I sped through this puzzle, although I came nowhere near that blazing speed (I definitely can’t). If you understand the trick early in your solve, you’ll probably feel the same. If you didn’t, never fear! It’s not easy, it’s clever, and it’s one of those that sneaks up on you like a really well-balanced spicy bowl of chili.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 There is a bit of a commonality between today’s grid and today’s variety puzzle, so if you liked this one and still have some big puzzle energy try the one called “Meshing Around.” It is certainly a coincidence and I will avoid

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Obviously we are going to see some very cool cluing today, given our constructor. I loved YESSIR, SPA, LIES, TSK, SCREW and others.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 I had “book” for GEAR because I don’t use a backpack, I am of average height and I look like a tortoise with one. Back in college I once took a backpack on a weekend trip with the Collected Chaucer in it and nothing else. I also drew a blank on some names, including AMECHE (because of how it was clued, I insist), SERT, DARLA and CELIE, who was played by Whoopi Goldberg but was still a toughie to me.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 29A: At first I glossed over this clue because I’m no chess expert, but I learned that this move, en PASSANT, is quite unusual and sneaky, and
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.chess.com/article/view/how-to-capture-en-passant" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  involves only pawns
 </a>
 , which is really nice because pawns don’t get much glory, do they. PASSANT is also a heraldic term, referring to that peculiar stance you sometimes see lions or dragons taking, on shields and crests and such, where one paw is raised dramatically in pre-pounce. Cool how this clue crosses over SPARES, another

 132A: This actress is also a rapper, and she’s from Queens! Look her up — AWKWAFINA. She’s a lot of fun and was just in the news this week for something earth-shattering — she’s the

 by the New York Botanical Garden. This is the kind of service journalism I am proud to bring you.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 29D: This clue — “Oink-filled pen” — seems as if it could be a sign that a whimsical farmer could buy on etsy.com to put above a PIGSTY. One where the pigs wear sweaters when it’s cold out and get artisanal plant-based slop. Also fabulous how this nearly ran into INK at 72D.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 32D: Think military time — this is TWO PM.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 73D: This is one you either know or you don’t know, I’m pretty sure, and it is a debut. Manga is a huge pop culture niche and SAILOR MOON is
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://sailormoon.fandom.com/wiki/Sailor_Moon_Wiki" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 97D: Think mama birds, or

  some Hollywood actresses
 </a>
 , who PRECHEW everything their precious progeny ingest.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 O.K., so I don’t know what made me start at the bottom of this puzzle (I have such a thing for Awkwafina, my brain must have made a beeline to her) — but if you get the clue to the explainer for the theme, at 121A, then the trick is self-explanatory. Still fun, though.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 There are seven theme entries, indicated by italic clues at 21, 40, 59, 64, 72, 84 and 99 Across. The clues solve to two-part entries, none of which are particularly obvious: I think I was about a third through the entire grid before I finished my first theme entry. That was 84A, “
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  Allen Ginsberg, e.g.,”
 </em>
 which solved to PROTEST POET. Sounds right to me, but it is anyone’s guess, given just that example, what Mr. Agard is getting at.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 A bit above this one at 64A, “
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  Posting that is blowing in the wind”
 </em>
 made me think of Bob Dylan and vaguely entertain the notion of a “freewheelin’” theme today, something that I would kind of love, and the answer here — SWINGING SIGN — did sort of fit the vibe, a little, sort of.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Then I finished the northwest corner, and with it the slightly city-slicker-snob clue at 21A, “
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  Likely inexpensive place to get one’s hair done,”
 </em>
 SMALL TOWN SALON. This was possibly the most stilted of the very smooth theme entries, and it did prompt an attempt to parse just what was going on here.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 You might notice that in each of these examples there is a preponderance of the same letters; in fact, every letter in the last part of each theme entry is included in the first part of the theme entry. In
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  fact
 </em>
 , every letter in the last part appears, in order, in every other letter position of the first part of the entry. Like so:

 Food Matters

<p class="css-ntp8xk e1wiw3jv0">
 The social media phenomenon of documenting seemingly unappetizing cuisine is helping us rethink what dishes are not only worth eating — but venerating.

 THE FISH REAR UP from the pie, almost a school of them, whole silvery pilchards — a type of herring — half buried, half erupting from the crust. Only their heads, eyes entreating the heavens, are visible, although some versions of the dish let the frilly tails surface, too, as if the fish were trapped midswim by an avalanche of dough. The rest of their bodies lie in the depths of the pie, leaching their brine into a rich custard, larded with bacon and hard-boiled eggs and spiked with mustard.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Such is the surreal glory of stargazy pie — also known as starry-gazy-pie — so called because the fish’s eyes appear to be “studying the stars,” according to the English antiquarian James Orchard Halliwell-Phillipps’s Dictionary of Archaic and Provincial Words (1846). Originally an English recipe from the cobblestone coastal village of Mousehole, Cornwall, the dish is believed to date to a season of famine in the 16th century, when (the story goes) one gutsy fisherman took to the stormy seas and hauled in enough marine life to feed the town. Its residents were so hungry that the bounty was baked all at once, in a single pie. Every year, on Dec. 23, locals celebrate the survival of their ancestors with a festival dedicated to the dish.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Beyond Cornwall, stargazy pie is largely unknown, even to many Brits. In China, however, this obscure regional specialty has become a subject of fascination, an exemplar of all that the Chinese find baffling about Western cooking. In 2012, an account on Douban — a social network focused on lifestyle and culture and whose reach as of September exceeds 300 million active monthly users — started sharing photographs from the British supper-club chef
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://msmarmitelover.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kerstin Rodgers’s blog
 </a>
 , including her version of stargazy pie. Commenters found the dish bizarre and suggested that the fish’s dignity had been compromised, although whether this was intended as criticism or comedy isn’t entirely clear. (Fish heads are featured without controversy in Chinese cooking, so perhaps the outrage was the dough.)
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Chinese have a name for food that challenges squeamish sensibilities:
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  hei an liao li
 </em>
 , roughly translated as “dark cuisine.” The term, of relatively recent vintage, is derived from “
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://mangarock.com/manga/mrs-serie-45112" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Chuuka Ichiban!
 </a>
 ” (“China’s Number One!”), a 1990s Japanese manga by Etsushi Ogawa, about a boy chef in 19th-century China who battles an underground crime syndicate called the Dark Cooking Society. Taken from this context, “dark” retains the sense of operating in the shadows and going beyond the bounds of what’s officially permitted. The term isn’t necessarily a pejorative; it’s used as an affectionate label for dishes that at first glance may seem off-putting, even downright alien, but whose very transgressiveness speaks to their charm.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Dark cuisine” is a supple phrase, not confined to unfamiliar foreign delicacies. “It can refer to anything that’s particularly hard to swallow,” explained
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.jingtheory.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Jenny Gao
 </a>
 , a Shanghai- and Los Angeles-based chef who was born in Chengdu, in southwestern China, and raised primarily in Canada. It applies to street food from stalls of suspect hygiene as well as “amateur disasters,” she said, but also, and more strikingly, to a trend of “deliberately made creative food that’s unexpected.” Under the flag of dark cuisine, home cooks and chefs alike have been experimenting with dubious combinations of ingredients: an omelet enclosing fresh kiwi wedges; granules of ban lan gen (isatis root), a bitter herbal medicine, dissolved into instant-noodle broth; a cloud of cotton candy melting into a bowl of zha jiang mian (a thick gravy of ground meat and soybean paste over noodles). This is public and performative, the results posted online for humor and shock value — although they’re also consumed, which is part of the joke: Look what
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  I
 </em>
 ate.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Some proponents of dark cuisine seek to maximize gruesomeness, as with cookies shaped into cut-off fingers and daubed with bloodlike jam. But others see the potential for achieving actual deliciousness: Gao first heard of dark cuisine last summer, when an employee at an ice cream shop in Chongqing was spotted spooning chile crisp — a scarlet oil heavy with crushed chiles, shallots fried into sweet shards and numbing Sichuan peppercorns — over vanilla soft serve. Once tasted, it wasn’t so outlandish: Hot and cold, crunch and cream, salt and sugar are natural partners. Gao was so taken by the juxtaposition of flavors and texture that she presented the same dessert at a launch party in Hollywood for her
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.flybyjing.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Fly by Jing
 </a>
 brand of chile crisp.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The embrace of such unorthodox pairings may seem frivolous, a passing fancy rather than a sign of some cultural shift. It’s worth remembering, however, that historically, the average citizen in China has not been rewarded for going against the grain, and the government still patrols internet activity. So there’s something slightly rebellious and restive about making absurd, potentially inedible food out of a few carelessly slapped-together ingredients, defying the strictures of centuries of elaborate Chinese cooking.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 IN THE WEST, there’s no true correlative to dark cuisine. Gao suggested a link to the towering milkshakes that briefly dominated Instagram a few years ago, with cupcakes sprouting from the froth like Athena from the head of Zeus. But for Westerners and particularly Americans, reared on individualism and the myth of the maverick who wins by breaking the rules, such oddball creations don’t carry much cultural freight. They’re just stoner food, thrown together at midnight or invented by amateur cooks out of desperation on food-competition shows such as MTV’s defunct “
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.mtv.com/shows/snack-off" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Snack-Off
 </a>
 ,” which earlier this decade encouraged the creation of intentionally yucky snacks, perhaps worst among them a creation that was cake filled with a Twinkie’s marshmallowy guts, then topped with candied apple and beef.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 More subversive are the minimalist and impeccably haute plates designed for Instagram by Chef Jacques La Merde (
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.instagram.com/chefjacqueslamerde/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  @chefjacqueslamerde
 </a>
 , the alias of the Toronto-based chef Christine Flynn) made up almost entirely of junk food, such as Velveeta foam, spherified Gatorade and Doritos crushed into a decorative “soil.” At the opposite end of the spectrum are the “struggle plates” highlighted by the account
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.instagram.com/cookingforbae/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  @cookingforbae
 </a>
 , memorializing the failures of home cooks: plasticky processed cheese slices wilted over French fries, perhaps, or octopus tentacles swarming from the cavity of a chicken (a picture that was, indeed, reposted by a Chinese Instagrammer with the hashtag
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/darkcuisine/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  #darkcuisine
 </a>
 ). While the satire of these accounts isn’t particularly profound — you get the point after a few posts — they share the same mission as dark cuisine, gleefully undermining the idea of conventionally beautiful (and therefore worthy) food.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 A similar interrogation takes place at the
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://disgustingfoodmuseum.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Disgusting Food Museum
 </a>
 , which opened in October 2018 in Malmo, Sweden, and recently mounted a two-month exhibition in Los Angeles. The collection of 80 items from 41 countries includes the likes of salty licorice from Scandinavia, sticky natto (fermented soybeans) from Japan and funky huitlacoche (a fungus that feeds on corn) from Mexico. Viewers are invited to sample certain dishes, with a complimentary barf bag in hand, just in case. “I want people to question what they find disgusting,” the lead curator, Samuel West, a Swedish clinical and organizational psychologist, has said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Still, the museum’s self-proclaimed “disgusting” holdings cite China more than any other country. Among the delights attributed to the nation are an anemic-pink coil of bull penis and rice wine infused with the corpses of baby mice, neither of which is actually consumed on a regular basis, and hardly the equivalent of the museum’s American contributions: root beer and Pop-Tarts. Even within China, some diners might look skeptically at mouse wine and call it dark cuisine; as Gao pointed out, China is so vast, what’s happily eaten in one province might be shunned as strange in another.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rodgers, the maker of the stargazy pie that won fame in China, wondered, in a 2017 conversation on her blog with the Chinese-cookbook author
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.instagram.com/fuchsiadunlop/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Fuchsia Dunlop
 </a>
 , why her dish had caused such a fuss. Dunlop replied, “You are just getting a taste of what it’s like the other way round” — the way the West routinely levies mockery at Eastern dishes. Earlier this decade,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://travel.cnn.com/explorations/eat/ireport-most-disgusting-foods-world-053021/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 </a>
 on CNN placed pidan, or century egg, a snack and ingredient beloved in China and throughout Southeast Asia — the egg preserved in slaked lime until the whites brown and the yolks turn green — on a list of the world’s “most ‘revolting’ ” foods. Pidan is enshrined at the Disgusting Food Museum, too. The American chef
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/28/dining/david-chang-kojin-toronto.html?module=inline" title="">
  David Chang
 </a>
 addresses such prejudice directly in the title of his Netflix series “
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80170368" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Ugly Delicious
 </a>
 ” (2018). In sampling regional delicacies from Japan, China, Mexico and the American South, he argues not simply that seemingly ugly dishes can, in fact, taste good, but that ugliness itself is a sham: a cultural construct. When Chang, who is of Korean descent, was growing up in Virginia in the 1980s, his peers thought the food he ate at home and brought for school lunches was “gross,” as he’s recalled. Now, they clamor for similar dishes at his 12 restaurants worldwide. Eating, one of the most basic human acts, can separate as much as connect us.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But consider again the stargazy pie. For diners from both East and West, whole sardines on a plate, however beady-eyed, would be unlikely to inspire dread; nor would a pie with an untroubled crust, seafood tidily tucked beneath. It’s the sight of the fish gasping to escape their pastry tomb that startles and thrills. The dish belongs to a category of food that compels us in part by repelling us — and draws us now perhaps more than ever, in an age when we’re relentlessly inundated with images of gorgeous food, when social media’s fantasy record of the way we eat is a ceaseless slide show of ingredients arrayed and lit down to the last centimeter.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Stargazy pie makes no accommodation for contemporary notions of what looks delicious or makes a dish an object of status or desire. It’s liberatingly unbeautiful; it doesn’t hide what it is. Instead, it offers the starkest, simplest, most comforting vision of how to live: Here is fish, here is pie. Let’s eat.

 Naomi Osaka, the half-Haitian, half-Japanese tennis champion, is the star of a new Japanese anime-style advertisement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The problem? The cartoon Ms. Osaka bears little resemblance to her real, biracial self.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Her skin was unmistakably lightened, and her hair style changed — a depiction that has prompted criticism in Japan, where she has

  challenged a longstanding sense of cultural and racial homogeneity
 </a>
 .
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The ad — unveiled this month by Nissin, one of the world’s largest instant-noodle brands — features Ms. Osaka and Kei Nishikori, Japan’s top-ranked male tennis player, in a cartoon drawn by a team commissioned by Nissin. The cartoon was based on the work of Takeshi Konomi, a well-known manga artist whose series “The Prince of Tennis” is popular in Japan.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ms. Osaka, who faces Elina Svitolina in an Australian Open quarterfinal match on Wednesday, and Mr. Konomi have not publicly commented on the reactions to the ad.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But a Nissin spokesman apologized in an email on Tuesday for “the confusion and discomfort.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The spokesman, Daisuke Okabayashi, said that the characters had been developed in line with Mr. Konomi’s anime series and that the company had communicated with Ms. Osaka’s representatives.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “There is no intention of whitewashing,” he said. “We accept that we are not sensitive enough and will pay more attention to diversity issue in the future.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 After the ad was first published online, people on social media, including many fans of Ms. Osaka’s, said they were deeply disappointed.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Baye McNeil, an author who has lived in Japan for 15 years, said he didn’t understand why the ad would “erase her black features and project this image of pretty much the prototypical anime girl-next-door character.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ms. Osaka’s rise into a beloved national figure has been particularly exciting for biracial people in Japan, known as hafus, who have long battled for acceptance, he said.

 Ms. Osaka was born in Japan to a Haitian-American father and a Japanese mother, and moved to the United States when she was 3. Although she isn’t fluent in Japanese, often responding to questions from Japanese reporters in English, she has tweeted about her love of manga and Japanese movies.

 at Japan Society (Jan. 25-26). After being set up, a former shogun executioner (Tomisaburo Wakayama) strikes out as a roving, freelance assassin. He offers his infant son a choice between a sword and a ball to play with, and the child, too young even to speak, reaches for the shiny weapon — sealing his fate to tag along.

 It’s almost too easy to write children’s books in which cats and dogs are the heroes and protagonists. By definition, our favorite pets are already amazing characters with distinct and hilarious personalities who loom large in our lives and imagination. But this spring brings a few standouts that young picture book listeners and readers will love.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 You know that dream you have where you’re trying to get somewhere, but every time you think you’ve arrived, a trapdoor flies open or something slips from your hands or you’re a split second too late to catch the train? The adorably frustrating
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  HOW TO GIVE YOUR CAT A BATH: In Five Easy Steps (Tundra, 40 pp., $17.99; ages 3 to 7),
 </strong>
 written by Nicola Winstanley (“Cinnamon Baby”) and illustrated by John Martz (“A Cat Named Tim”), is the preschool version of that. The mission is simple: An ambitious little girl with two bright pink buns wants to give her cat, Mr. Flea, a bath. The execution of this plan? Not so simple.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 There’s the matter of water temperature and level, not to mention the fact that we are talking about, um, a cat. Mr. Flea, like most members of his species, isn’t a huge fan of getting wet, and before we know it, five steps become 10-plus steps, as Mr. Flea’s owner gives chase around the house, scarfing down cookies (a crucial step, naturally) and destroying the house along the way. Reminiscent of the “If You Give a Moose a Muffin” series, it will have young readers slapping their foreheads in exasperation, but will reward them with a sweet, funny ending. (As well as a lesson: Sometimes the easiest way to do something is the most obvious.) Martz’s colorful line drawings match the happy, manic energy.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Unlike many of the cats who appear in children’s books (and New Yorker cartoons for that matter), the protagonist of
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  BRUNO, THE STANDING CAT (Random House, 48 pp. $17.99; ages 3 to 7),
 </strong>
 written by Nadine Robert and illustrated by Jean Jullien, possesses none of the stereotypical calculating aloofness that makes our feline friends such ready-made caricatures. What he does have, however, is a very special trait: He can stand upright on two legs, just like a human!
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 After Bruno shows up in a cardboard box on young Peter’s doorstep, the two become fast friends, as they romp through parks and play house together and celebrate all the remarkable things Bruno can do that typical cats cannot. Bruno can’t chase mice, but he can ride a skateboard. He can’t chase a ball of yarn, but he can pour a cup of tea. He doesn’t scratch his claws everywhere, but he knows how to blow a bubble with bubble gum. Upside down! Peter takes tremendous pride in his new friend’s uniqueness, and the evergreen message is as satisfying as ever: Fitting in is
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  soooo
 </em>
 boring! Fans of the French illustrator Jullien will recognize his signature graphic images and his gift for infusing humor into the simplest of renderings. It’s hard to look at Bruno’s expressive yellow eyeballs and not laugh.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Drooly fool. Sardine stinker. Sheepskin with legs. Werewolf. Wet mop. Mangy. Shredhead. These are only a fraction of the words used to address the poor, nameless hero of
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  DUMPSTER DOG! (Enchanted Lion, 64 pp., $17.99; ages 7 to 10),
 </strong>
 written by Colas Gutman and illustrated by Marc Boutavant; translated by Claudia Bedrick and Allison M. Charette. This chapter book — already popular in France, where it has been made into a hit TV show — is for kids who can appreciate a little more action and a lot more voice in their reading. (There’s more than a hint of Lemony Snicket’s dark hilarity in Gutman’s writing.)
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Born in a garbage can and best friends with Flat Cat (so named for being run over by a truck at 3 months old), our friend may be the most lovable ding-a-ling to come along since Amelia Bedelia. He dreams of finding an owner even while he’s not entirely sure what an owner is. After some hapless adventures as a failed guard dog, he finds his forever home by doing what dogs do best: being resilient and remaining loyal to those who count on him. Boutavant’s characters aren’t your typical cute and cuddly types — they’re rough around the edges and a little off. (Think George Booth’s famously agitated pets.) In other words, they look exactly how you want them to look.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  OLIVE &amp; PEKOE: In Four Short Walks (Greenwillow, 40 pp., $17.99; ages 3 to 7),
 </strong>
 written by Jacky Davis (the Ladybug Girl series) and illustrated by Giselle Potter (“This Is My Dollhouse”), the title characters have their differences, like most friends. Olive is old and wise, Pekoe is young and starry-eyed. Olive is patient and calm, Pekoe is excitable and rambunctious. Olive sees the big picture, Pekoe has a hard time seeing beyond what’s right in front of him, as when they encounter a mean dog and rowdy play at the dog park. “Pekoe is bothered by some of their rough behavior, Olive understands that most dogs are all bark and no bite.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The adventures of the two mixed-breed dogs are organized not by four acts but by four walks, and we get to watch the affectionate dynamic unfold between the friends as they walk in the woods, console each other during a thunderstorm and encounter a chipmunk. On that last walk: “Olive is not impressed to see a chipmunk darting through the leaves. Pekoe can’t believe how great it is that the world has chipmunks in it.” It’s a good reminder that one of the strongest cases for having a friend who is different is that you get to see the world through a completely different set of eyes. Potter’s artwork will remind you of classic Maira Kalman: warm, colorful, somehow both fanciful and sophisticated.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 We’ve all heard it before: Live with your pet long enough and you start to resemble each other — maybe even rub off on each other. In the charming
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  MY CAT LOOKS LIKE MY DAD (Owlkids, 32 pp., $17.99; ages 4 to 8),
 </strong>
 by Thao Lam (“Wallpaper”), the narrator walks us through how similar her mop-headed father is to their lazy, shaggy cat. They look alike, they share an affection for milk and sardines (“ewwww”); they stretch early in the morning and nap in the afternoon; they’re afraid of heights and aren’t exactly the tidiest members of the house.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 A special twist at the end serves to remind us that family can be defined in many ways beyond blood and physical resemblance, and when you spend enough time with someone, share a house and meals and the most mundane moments of day-to-day life, that’s as good a definition as any. Lam’s brightly colored paper-collage illustrations are unique and silly, a winning combination.

 Countless picture books follow the same narrative structure, in which a character faces a challenge and then — at the end of approximately 500 words — overcomes that challenge, or doesn’t. We call this
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  story
 </em>
 . “Read me a story,” a child might beg, and so we do.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But not all picture books are
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  stories
 </em>
 in the traditional sense, and often poetry is the tool that frees an author from the expectations of conflict and resolution. By trusting language, form, rhythm or sound to hold the reader’s focus, a poet is able to slow down or speed up, to observe or reflect. Picture books in verse can meditate or meander, imagine or reminisce, examine one small aspect of the world carefully, or elicit deep emotion.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 One thing that sets picture books apart from titles for older readers is that we often share them with another person. In
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  BOOM, BELLOW, BLEAT: Animal Poems for Two or More Voices (WordSong, 32 pp., $19.95; ages 3 to 6),
 </strong>
 Georgia Heard’s text leans into this interactive experience, creating the space for distinct speakers in each poem. Each is intended as a sort of duet, with the text set in different colors to differentiate the alternating parts.
 <br/>
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The book relies heavily on the humor and child-friendly simplicity of animal noises, but the noises animals make are not always what you’d expect. In “We Don’t Say Ribbit,” a frog and toad offer the less expected noises they might actually make in the wild, from “quonk” to “errrgh,” almost certain to entice laughter from young readers.
 <br/>
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In several of these poems, the language is more mature, as in “Flight of the Honeybees,” where “Pale celery parasols” or “yellow petaled broccoli” may be a challenge to younger readers. But the beauty of poetry for small children is that the sounds of words can be appealing long before their meanings are fully understood.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Many of these poems also incorporate refrains, allowing a young listener to repeat after another reader, as in “Song Thief,” where the second reader, as mockingbird, repeats everything the first reader has just said. “Why is it / why is it / what I sing / what I sing / you sing too?” Heard’s engaging poems, paired with Aaron DeWitt’s bright digital images of the natural world, are designed to bring readers together, and with an informative author’s note on various elements of the natural world, they may also find a welcome role in the classroom.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Each tree offers / a story…” begins Verlie Hutchens and Jing Jing Tsong’s
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  TREES (Beach Lane, 40 pp., $17.99; ages 4 to 8)
 </strong>
 and what unfolds is exactly that, a series of brief character studies, as page after page, readers are introduced to a surprisingly varied cast of arboreal personalities.
 <br/>
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Gracefully, each spread offers a distinct new friend for young readers. Pussy willow is shy, waiting for the one week in spring when “kitten velvet buds / adorn her modest twigs.” By contrast, White Pine is an “unruly uncle,” with his “buttons akilter” and “shaggy hair unkempt.” Each tree is memorable, and Hutchens’s vivid descriptions are full of movement and relatable moments. Tsong’s colorful illustrations invite readers to peer from a range of vantage points and angles, as if looking down through the foliage. Young readers on walks may well experience the canopy above them a little differently after encountering the trees through Hutchens’s and Tsong’s eyes.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Yet the book may do little to help them see people differently, since “Trees” also reinforces traditional gender roles. Female-identified trees are described as “silly” as they dance on “tippy toes” and sport “baubles.” Meanwhile, the masculine trees are “strong” and “mighty” as well as “wise.” An unfortunate choice for a book that might easily have resisted such bias.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In reading poetry, we are sometimes so lulled by rhythm and sound that we forget to pay attention to meaning. This can be especially true with familiar poems, as they become ingrained in our consciousness. A picture book version of Robert Frost’s
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  THE ROAD NOT TAKEN (Familius, 40 pp., $17.99; ages 4 to 8)
 </strong>
 , with illustrations by Vivian Mineker, does a wonderful job of reintroducing a well-known poem without altering a single word. The choice to redivide stanzas and to rebreak lines, as well as to set the poem in the contemporary-feeling world of Mineker’s soft palette, invites a fresh reading.
 <br/>
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In the beginning of the book, a young boy with a backpack stands near his dog, at a fork in the road. “Two roads diverged in a yellow wood.” As the text reflects on this moment, we view him from a distance, and then from far above. We witness the boy’s indecision, and finally his seemingly arbitrary choice.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 From there, the book continues, and we journey along with the poem and the boy, as he grows, goes to school, chooses a career and builds a family. Finally, at the poem’s poignant end, we face the old man who has been reciting the poem and reminiscing all along, surrounded by his grandchildren. “And that has made all the difference.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This is a book that begs rereading. Visually, it’s unclear what beckons the boy along his initial path, and there’s a sort of randomness, a meandering mazelike quality to the artwork, if an emotional inevitability to the poem’s conclusion. Robert Frost might well have approved that ambiguity.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “This is for the unforgettable / the swift and sweet ones / who hurdled history / and opened a world / of possible.” The beginning of Kwame Alexander and Kadir Nelson’s
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  THE UNDEFEATED (Versify/Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 40 pp., $17.99; ages 4 and up)
 </strong>
 feels anthemic.
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  Listen up,
 </em>
 the book seems to say,
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  I’m going to share something important
 </em>
 .
 <br/>
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 What follows is a powerful tribute to the African-American experience, replete with joy and pride in the accomplishments of individual artists and athletes, leaders and thinkers. But the book also communicates a strong sense of the suffering without which this history would be incomplete. Alexander’s resonant twisting language, and Nelson’s rich painterly style, serve to capture not just individuals but the community as a whole.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “The ones who survived / America / by any means necessary.” The book continues. “And the ones who didn’t.” This second line of text is set starkly against blank white pages, demanding that the reader consider the lives lost and the voices silenced by our history.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 We see this same kind of restraint a little further along, in the startling repetition of “This is for the unspeakable.” Three spreads repeat this simple line, allowing the reader to sit with images of unforgivable acts from both past and present, inviting us to silently bear witness when words fail.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Elsewhere, the text swells again, as words and art offer a litany of historical figures and important moments, filling the ears with rhythms that demand attention, calling on poetry of the past. “This is for the unbelievable / The We Real Cool ones. / This is for the unbending. / The black as the night is beautiful ones.” These lines sing, and the accompanying paintings feel like a walk through a portrait gallery.

 Poetry knows when to lean forward and when to pull back, and in “The Undefeated,” Alexander has walked that line perfectly. This book will fill readers with a sense of the wealth and the cost of history.

  Dear Match Book,
 </strong>
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 I like to read nonfiction books that have been turned into movies. I don’t care which order I encounter them in: If I read the book first, I like to follow up with the movie to see how the filmmakers streamlined the plot, but I’ll also go from movie to book. (I recently watched “A Civil Action,” then found the book by Jonathan Harr at a used-book store.)
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 I’m rarely disappointed by the literary counterparts, one exception being “Julie and Julia,” by Julie Powell — I far preferred the film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 I’ve read Terry Ryan’s memoir, “The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio,” which I thought was superb, but I haven’t seen the movie yet. I enjoyed both versions of Erich von Däniken’s classic “Chariots of the Gods” (I watched the movie first).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 I recently picked up “The Monuments Men,” by Robert M. Edsel, since I have already seen the film. I’m also looking forward to reading and watching “The Radium Girls,” by Kate Moore, as well as to tackling both page and screen versions of “The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks,” by Rebecca Skloot.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Can you recommend any other nonfiction books that have been made into movies?
</p>

  Dear Kristine,
 </strong>
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The mind’s eye of a reader — what allows you to picture, say, the views from the Pacific Crest Trail as conjured by Cheryl Strayed in “Wild,” or the graffitied walls of the bus-turned-shelter described by Jon Krakauer in “Into the Wild” (both ideal adds to your page-to-screen list) — might also hold some back from appreciating adaptations: Once built, the sets readers have constructed in their minds can be hard to strike. Your unique flexibility, though — a kind of double vision — allows you to see the distinct strengths and architectures of each form.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  Now Playing
 </strong>
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Given Hollywood’s penchant for recycling narratives, examples that fit your search abound. I’ll mention just a couple of handfuls. Start with two 2018 big-screen adaptations with excellent source material and Academy Award nominations. Spike Lee’s “BlacKkKlansman” sprang from Ron Stallworth’s “Black Klansman,” a memoir as lean and brisk as a screenplay. In it the first black cadet to become a police officer in Colorado Springs, in 1974, details his strange and dangerous undercover investigation of the Ku Klux Klan. Identity, as seen from the opposite side of the law, also plays a part in “Can You Ever Forgive Me?,” the delectable autobiography by a literary biographer turned literary forger, Lee Israel, adapted into a movie of the same name directed by Marielle Heller.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  Self, Made
 </strong>
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Skillful adaptations of (still more) personal narratives, which provide rich source material for filmmakers, can link the two types of storytelling inextricably. I still hold a grudge against Robert De Niro for the way he treated Leonardo DiCaprio, as Tobias Wolff, while playing his stepfather in the adaptation of Wolff’s memoir, “This Boy’s Life.” And just as Penny Marshall’s movie version of “Awakenings” led to a wider appreciation of Oliver Sacks’s writing, I wish that the director Jane Campion’s intimate “An Angel at My Table,” an adaptation of three volumes of the New Zealander Janet Frame’s memoirs (including scenes from her time in a psychiatric hospital), had led to a broader and more sustained readerly embrace of all of Frame’s vibrant and contemplative work.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And in another cinematic take on a young woman’s personal account of her stay in a psychiatric institution — Susanna Kaysen’s “Girl, Interrupted” — Angelina Jolie’s portrayal of one of Kaysen’s fellow patients won her an Academy Award.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 An even more extreme confinement marks “The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,” Jean-Dominique Bauby’s slim book, which he composed post-stroke by blinking his words to an assistant, one letter at a time. The visually arresting movie, directed by the painter Julian Schnabel, shifts the key characters in Bauby’s life, making for interesting contrast.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  The Big Picture
 </strong>
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Finally, the narrative sweep of books on history, space, sports, etc. have led to a string of big-budget feature film successes: Laura Hillenbrand’s “Seabiscuit” and “Unbroken,” Margot Lee Shetterly’s “Hidden Figures,” and Doris Kearns Goodwin’s “Team of Rivals,” which became Steven Spielberg’s “Lincoln.” This category also includes two books that made the most surprising (to me anyway) and smooth transitions to film: Michael Lewis’s “Moneyball” and “The Big Short.” Chalk it up to movie magic.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">

 African-American picture books have always been successful at capturing the breadth, depth and beauty of the black experience, allowing children to gain much-needed access to the strong legacy and vibrant history of African-American art and storytelling. But how we present this story is always undergoing revision and refinement, as four new books — from a closer view of plantation life to a visually rich depiction of the history of hip-hop — show. In these books, word and art combine to give us fresh insight into the lives, creativity and achievements of a truly resilient and profound people.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 James E. Ransome’s
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  THE BELL RANG (Atheneum, 40 pp., $17.99; ages 4 to 8)
 </strong>
 beautifully captures several days in the life of an enslaved girl living with her family on a plantation. Plantation life is seen through the innocent yet fiercely observant eyes of the young, nameless narrator. Each day begins with the ringing of a bell, a warm hug, a loving kiss on the forehead or a gentle touch on the shoulder, followed by a simple goodbye from her big brother, Ben. Ransome doesn’t shy away from the trauma of slavery, but he balances the terror that sits at the core of the story with moments of joy, skillfully painting a subtle smile across the young girl’s face when she’s given a doll, or the shadows of children running, skipping rope and playing hopscotch.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 We don’t witness the daily, backbreaking work in the field, and a whipping happens offstage, but we do see the pervasive, watchful overseers, with their guns and their hound dog. At one point Ransome paints tears streaming down Mama’s face, Daddy’s bowed head against a wall with our narrator leaning against him, and an overseer with clenched fists standing in a doorway. “No sun in the sky. Mama crying. No Ben. Daddy crying. Ben ran,” he writes.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The book’s color palette, strong on grays and pale blues, conveys its honest yet hopeful depiction of its young narrator’s situation. We are left with the question, Will she run, too, some day? In “The Bell Rang” Ransome has given us a bittersweet slice of plantation life, one in which innocence, familial love and safety are juxtaposed with pain, loss and the resilience of the enslaved.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  LET ’ER BUCK! George Fletcher, the People’s Champion (Carolrhoda, 40 pp., $18.99; ages 4 to 8),
 </strong>
 written by Vaunda Micheaux Nelson (“Bad News for Outlaws”) and illustrated by the Newbery Honor winner Gordon C. James (“Crown: An Ode to the Fresh Cut”), tells the story of the black cowboy George Fletcher, whose journey began when his family set out on the Oregon Trail from their Kansas town. After they met with racism, young George found solace among the children on the Umatilla Indian Reservation in eastern Oregon. There, he nurtured his love of riding with a make-believe bronco, but over time, the tribal horsemen taught George how to “buck.” He became a star at local rodeos, even while being shut out of more popular ones, which opposed black cowboys competing against white cowboys. But in 1911 the 21-year-old George competed against the fiercest cowboys in the Northwest: the Nez Percé Indian Jackson Sundown and the white rancher John Spain.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 What follows is a detailed account, rendered adroitly through Nelson’s clear prose and James’s elegant paintings, of one of the most important rodeo shows in American history, which established Fletcher as the “people’s champion” — even though the judge declared Spain the winner. With its energetic pairing of words and art, “Let ’er Buck!” comes alive to unearth an unsung American hero.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Gwendolyn Brooks, who died in 2000, was one of the most important, prolific and distinguished poets of her time, and as with most brilliant artists, her creative force was evident when she was a child. In
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  A SONG FOR GWENDOLYN BROOKS (Sterling, 32 pp., $17.99; ages 4 to 8)
 </strong>
 , Alice Faye Duncan and Xia Gordon unfurl Brooks’s evolution from a precocious girl growing up in Chicago through her boundary-breaking accomplishments, including the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1950. “Sing a song for Gwendolyn Brooks. Sing it loud — a Chicago blues,” Duncan’s text begins. Gordon’s soft, velvety, earth-toned illustrations convey the sweetness and innocence of Gwendolyn’s imagination, set against the vibrant urban landscape of her childhood. Duncan mimics the short, poignant stanzas and lyrical observations in many of Brooks’s poems — a few of which are placed throughout, beginning with “The Busy Clock,” written in 1928 when she was 11. Yet it is the way Duncan conveys the unwavering family support of Brooks’s creativity that most stands out. “Her parents are wise and see the light. … Gwendolyn is free to sit and think,” she writes. Brooks writes and rewrites a poem titled “Ambition” between 1930 and 1933, as she went from 13 to 16 years old, and Duncan uses it to illustrate the persistence, isolation and deep self-reflection that poetry required of Brooks. As she goes on to achieve fame, we are reminded that the joyous freedom of her work traces back to the remarkable achievements of a child poet.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  THE ROOTS OF RAP: 16 Bars on the Pillars of Hip-Hop (Little Bee, 32 pp., $18.99; ages 4 to 8)
 </strong>
 captures a specific African-American experience — one that is rooted in jazz, hip-hop and the liveliness of urban culture. Carole Boston Weatherford’s 16 bars of homage to the history of hip-hop accompany the celebrated illustrator Frank Morrison’s pulsing and vibrant images, which not only convey the development of hip-hop, they dance on the page.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The opening pages are a tip of the baseball cap to the poets Langston Hughes and Paul Lawrence Dunbar, as well as to James Brown — innovators of spoken word and funk music, and thus contributors to the roots of hip-hop. Graffiti figures prominently throughout the book, too, as it is a foundational aesthetic in hip-hop, and provides a colorful backdrop to the groovin’ and movin’ black children who populate the illustrations. The well-placed centerfold illustration is of a cool and smooth DJ Kool Herc, known as the founding father of hip-hop, with his turntable and mic. “DJ Kool Herc in the Bronx, block party under his command, rocks and rocks nonstop; mic clutched in his hand,” Weatherford writes. While “The Roots of Rap” certainly does document the history of hip-hop, Weatherford forgoes the ingenious wordplay, jazzy meter and funky rhyme scheme found in early rap songs like the Sugar Hill Gang’s “Rapper’s Delight” and Kurtis Blow’s “The Breaks.” It is Morrison’s illustrations that give “The Roots of Rap” its beat, its bass, rhythm and soul.

 Thong and Parra have explored shapes (“Round Is a Tortilla”) and colors (“Green Is a Chile Pepper”) with adorable bilingual flair, and this take on the numbers one to 10 is just as appealing. Each object is named in Spanish, with surrounding text in English (“six flavored aguas to quench our thirst”), while Parra’s folk-art illustrations give visual clues to scenes from Latino life. Each friendly page beckons — to find stuff to count, or just to imagine lying on the beach under one of the five palapas.

 A protective tabby named Muffin, a shop called Little Bear Bakery, a nighttime intruder. Is it a giant mouse? Or … a baby bear, helping herself to the goodies? Muffin is on the case. Sarcone-Roach (“The Bear Ate Your Sandwich”) draws her audience in with I’m-the-boss cat humor and expressive mixed-media art in shades of blue and orange, perfectly capturing moods ranging from a terrified kitty (“I was smooshed, like a muffin between the couch cushions”) to a satisfying bear hug. This delightful caper calls out for multiple readings.

 Admit it, that annual wish you make before blowing out the candles is a huge deal. This antic step-by-step guide at first plays it for laughs, pulling in dinosaurs, rhinos, penguins and many more creatures to sow amusing chaos. Dogs howl the birthday song off-key, and puffer fish are warned not to take a big breath. But the always vibrant Lichtenheld and Ferry turn sweetly serious for the moment we’ve been waiting for, with a gentle reminder: “Don’t forget that wish ends in ‘shhhhhh.’”

 This latest from Ruzzier (the Fox &amp; Chick books) has just one or two words per page. But with lovely art that turns effortlessly surreal, that’s all it takes to tell a clever, comical story of a truly mutual relationship. A boy and his dog, whose coat is the same shade of yellow as the boy’s hair, practice canine training commands like “Sit” and “Jump” that soon morph into wondrous feats like “Cook.” Before you know it, the devoted pair are off on an outer-space adventure.

 In this exquisite story of generosity from the beloved McKissack, who died in 2017, a little boy named James Otis and his mama have fallen on hard times after his father’s death. But they keep their spirits up, focusing on a request by their minister to add to a “love box” for a family that lost everything in a fire. Harrison has created soft yet dazzling illustrations for this tribute to faith, hope and the African-American community.

 All apartment buildings contain tantalizing mysteries, and the red-haired girl who narrates this zany treat tells what’s behind each door in hers: a tiger, a vampire, a family that “celebrates someone’s birthday at least once a week.” Tsarfati (“An After Bedtime Story”) balances visual extravagance with sneaky insight into how kids think of home.

 The sea creatures who populate Tsurumi’s underwater idyll live harmoniously, yet each does its own thing, including Crab, who bakes cakes. But when someone dumps trash into their home, the psychedelic colors darken. What to do? The eco-friendly lesson goes down easy as “everybody comes together,” pitching in to haul the trash away, with another cake from Crab waiting at the end.

 Like all Tan’s genre-defying books, this one vibrates with profound questions about how we choose to live and how we treat one another. A gray-suited cicada is an office drone, insulted and underpaid by the humans; he lives in an office wall space. After 17 years, he’s shown the door. Despondent, he seems about to jump from the roof, but instead sheds the suit and becomes dozens of bright red insects, flying away to freedom.

 Ungerer was perhaps best known, especially in the United States, for his children’s books. He created the “Mellops” series, about a family of pigs and their misadventures, which included spelunking, striking oil and diving for treasure. He also wrote and illustrated the classic children’s book, “Crictor,” about a boa constrictor who manages to become a local hero.

 I have two toddlers at home. And the littler, at 18 months, is finally eager to sit through a book, or seven, if they engage her. She climbs up next to me on the couch while I drink my morning coffee, pointing and shouting, “Book, book, book!” Or, if I’m already holding one and haven’t started quickly enough, she’ll shout: “Read! Read!” My 3-year-old is captivated by surprising or funny-sounding words, and already appreciates some of my favorite books from childhood (I have, naturally, read him nearly all of William Steig, to me the undisputed master of children’s literature), as well as many newer picture books with good stories.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But when both kids are on my lap, the chunkier board books, with fewer words and a smaller format, are best. I’ve learned to perform, as the added theatricality both pleases my son’s desire for wordplay and sonic delight and helps keep my daughter’s attention. These new board books find ways to break down the barriers between little listeners and the books themselves, helping parents like me put on a successful story time show.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “You can read this book in the bath,” begins
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  HUG THIS BOOK! (Phaidon, 30 pp., $9.95; ages 0 to 4)
 </strong>
 , written by Barney Saltzberg and illustrated by Fred Benaglia. This one started out as a bigger picture book, but the new board book version is a clear winner, inviting touch and placing the youngest readers right in the middle of the action, in a familiar location. Later, they are told, “If you read this book being tickled, I dare you not to laugh.” Stimulated from awareness to empathic interest, my kids were enraptured, aware the book was talking about itself, directly to them. “You can kiss and hug and smell this book” elicited tiny smooching sounds from my daughter, while my son leaned in close and sniffed it. The sketchy, energetic illustrations in a limited but bright palette charmed us all. As if more proof was needed that the kids and this book were on the same wavelength, my son asked me to read it again even before we got to the last page: “Even though this book is over, it isn’t really the end. You can start at the beginning and read it to a friend.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 You know those books you carefully move to the bottom of the stack because you can’t stand to read them one more time? Well,
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  ANIMAL SHAPES (Little Bee, 40 pp., $11.99; ages 0 to 4)
 </strong>
 , written and illustrated by Christopher Silas Neal, is the opposite kind of book: so surprising and pleasing to an adult repeat reader like me that I even found myself suggesting it to the kids. With saturated colors and clean design, the book is a hilarious smooshing together of the two things in the title. (Another smooshing-together book by Neal, “Animal Colors,” was published at the same time, so a series may be in the making.) “When a soaring bird meets a triangle, they become a fly-angle,” one example reads, illustrated by a red bird from above, flying through the sky as an equilateral triangle. And while the book is educational, technically, introducing kids to shapes from a simple square to a nonagon, the lesson is beside the point. The mash-up is simply fun to see, and to say. “When jumbled giraffes meet a rectangle, they become a neck-tangle.” My kids couldn’t identify each shape, but they got the humor, repeating “neck-tangle” and laughing.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 As a story lover by trade and inclination, I’m not much of a fan of wordless picture books.
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  A PILE OF LEAVES (Phaidon, 24 pp., $18.95; ages 0 to 4)
 </strong>
 , by Jason Fulford and Tamara Shopsin, is an exception, and not just because it actually begins with a page of words: “A pile of leaves is like a collage. Each layer adds something new and hides something underneath.” After that comes a twist: see-through pages that let you peer through a transparent window inside a colored frame. Each surprisingly sturdy plastic page shows a layer: a leaf or two, an acorn, ants and a leaf, a grasshopper and two leaves. Then, under that top layer are lost objects — a mitten, a key — the kinds of things that might be misplaced during a romp through a pile of leaves. My kids and I paged through the book once, silently. Then we started over and talked through it, discussing leaves and piles and missing objects. “It’s like digging through a toy basket for a missing piece,” my son said.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  MY FIRST PULL-TAB FAIRY TALES (Auzou, 10 pp. each, $10.99 each; ages 0 to 6)
 </strong>
 series, illustrated by Marion Cocklico, doesn’t offer innovative twists on the original tales, but it does provide a great, simplified, engaging way to introduce young kids to some classics, including “Pinocchio,” “Little Red Riding Hood” and “Goldilocks and the Three Bears.” The design is genius — pages sturdy enough to withstand thousands of pushes and pulls from tiny hands, with pull-tabs built into each page to avoid those dangling tags or folds of paper that rip or stop functioning almost immediately. The “Goldilocks” volume is cleverly designed with ways for small fingers to pull, push and slide Goldilocks through her adventurous intrusion inside the bears’ house. On my favorite page, Goldi is asleep in the bed that was
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  just right,
 </em>
 until you pull the tab and she awakens to the intense stares of the three bears with hands on their hips, standing in the doorway. My daughter’s favorite? The front door she could slide open to reveal a cat — again, and again, and again.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 I was skeptical when I initially opened the box that contains
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  HOUSE: FIRST WORD BOARD BOOKS (Chronicle, 12 pp., $18.99; ages 0 to 3)
 </strong>
 , written and illustrated by Michael Slack, a set of five books nestled together. I loved the groovy 1960s look of the cover, but I worried it would be all gimmick, no charm. Yet as soon as I lifted the lid, the kids dived in, prying out the small books, each named for a different room in the house. As they opened them, they “read” them out loud, naming the objects they saw: “Sofa! Computer! Window!” in the living room book. My son selected the garage book and shouted: “Car! Recycling! VACUUM CLEANER!” (He has a passion for vacuums, so this was a true highlight.) Both kids grinned with the pleasure of reading their perfectly sized books to me, rather than the reverse, pointing to objects and identifying them. It’s the ideal kind of kid-design, smartly conceived to appeal to and engage little readers, and requiring no explanation or instructions. That night my daughter carried several of the smallest books in the set with her to bed — well, who else could they have been meant for?

 Avid readers of Robert A. Caro may greet his new book, “Working: Researching, Interviewing, Writing,” with a mixture of excitement and trepidation. On the one hand: Another Caro book, and it’s not a biography! On the other hand: Another Caro book — and it’s not a biography?
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Considering that the 83-year-old averages a book a decade, his fans might wonder whether “Working” will reset the clock that started in 2012, when the fourth book of his multivolume magnum opus, “The Years of Lyndon Johnson,” was published.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 No need to worry, though this assemblage of personal reflections and interviews may give the true Caro completist a creeping sense of déjà vu. Much of the material was either published before or distilled from stories Caro has recounted elsewhere, and the book reads as if it were designed to divert as little of his time as possible. (Caro says he has a “full-scale memoir” planned, to be completed
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  after
 </em>
 the next Johnson volume, though at his age, he says, he can also “do the math.”) Small and charming at about 200 pages, a quick spritz instead of a deep dive, “Working” is like the antithesis of Caro’s labor-intensive oeuvre, making it strangely reassuring proof that he is, well, working.
</p>

</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The next Johnson book will be “the fifth of a projected three volumes,” he writes, declining to get into specifics (“My writing seems never to come out well if I’ve talked about it beforehand”) while promising that it will be the final installment. That means it will have to cover, among other things, the presidential election of 1964; Johnson’s Great Society programs and his continuing feud with Bobby Kennedy; the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act; the decision not to run for re-election in 1968; Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination; Bobby Kennedy’s assassination; and Johnson’s post-presidency life until his death in 1973.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Not to mention the escalation of the war in Vietnam, a subject about which “the L.B.J. Library is opening up new files all the time.” It sounds like biography writing as Zeno’s paradox — getting infinitesimally closer to the end without ever reaching it.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Caro, though, wouldn’t have it any other way. His research methods are deservedly legendary. He and his wife, Ina, pore through archival documents with a determination to “turn every page.” He tracks down as many people to talk to as he can, counting 522 interviews for “The Power Broker,” his landmark biography of Robert Moses, and “thousands” for the Johnson books.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But these standard techniques are just a start. He and Ina moved from their home in New York to the Texas Hill Country in 1978, living there for three years to better understand Johnson’s childhood. (To get the local women to warm to her and open up about what their lives were like before Johnson brought electricity to the region in the ’30s and ’40s, Ina taught herself how to make fig preserves.) Caro has said he
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/02/books/robert-caro-nearing-the-end-of-his-epic-lbj-bio-eyes-a-trip-to-vietnam.html?module=inline" title="">
  wants to spend time in Vietnam
 </a>
 to get a sense of what it felt like “to fight in the jungle.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 All of this painstaking work takes time. The writing itself comes quickly and easily — so much so that the critic R.P. Blackmur, who taught Caro at Princeton, admonished him to “stop thinking with your fingers.” The prose in Caro’s biographies is a mesmerizing combination of fine-grained, meticulous detail recounted in lush, incantatory sentences; he is, as he says repeatedly in “Working,” always trying to accumulate enough material to “show” rather than to tell — “to make readers not only see but understand and feel” the consequences of power.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Because power, Caro says, is his real subject. He doesn’t think of his books as biographies in the conventional sense. “From the very start,” he writes, “I thought of writing biographies as a means of illuminating the times of the men I was writing about and the great forces that molded those times.” Robert Moses was an unelected bureaucrat whose public works projects transformed the skyline and shorelines of New York City; Lyndon Johnson was a ruthless opportunist and an astonishingly effective legislator who transformed the country’s social landscape. These were men who channeled power, wielded it, embodied it.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Caro talks a lot about power in “Working.” It can corrupt, yes, but not always. “Once you get enough power, once you’re there, where you wanted to be all along, then you can see what the protagonist wanted to do all along, because now he’s doing it,” he says. “What power
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  always
 </em>
 does is reveal.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s a memorable line, from an interview Caro gave to The Paris Review in 2016. It appears not only in “Working” but also in “Master of the Senate,” the third of the Johnson books, published in 2002. There are a number of anecdotes in “Working” that Caro has shared before — after all, his books are so comprehensive that it only makes sense for, say, “Means of Ascent,” the second book in the Johnson series, to include a section on how Caro tracked down Luis Salas, a former voting official who confessed to helping Johnson steal the 1948 Senate election.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The version of the Salas story that Caro includes in “Working” is presented as an example of what Caro calls “something in my nature” — “the part of me that, now that I was writing books, kept leading me, after I had gotten every question answered, to suddenly think, despite myself, of new questions that, in the instant of thinking them, I felt must be answered for my book to be complete.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This is awfully windy — where is Prof. Blackmur when you need him? Caro makes the same point more succinctly when writing about “The Power Broker,” recalling how he was swept away by the scandalous material he was discovering and an accompanying sense of duty. “I just
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  couldn’t
 </em>
 write the book about the great highway builder — couldn’t outline it, even — without showing the human cost of what he had done,” he writes. “There really was no choice involved.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 For someone so interested in the power of others, Caro seems coy about his own power to shape legacies. The writer who emerges from these pages is so humble as to be self-effacing — a quality that makes his halting bids at introspection, for all their genial appeal, seem mostly denuded of the drama that normally fuels Caro’s work.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But then the stubborn willingness to keep digging, to rescue secrets from oblivion, is a form of power, too. Recalling why Moses finally relented and agreed to talk to him, Caro writes: “At last someone had come along who was going to write the book whether he cooperated or not.”

 I recently read about an elementary school class that was studying the American Revolution. Each student chose a historical figure to write about. When the teacher asked if anyone had picked a woman, a little girl called out: “No! There were no women then!” Even in 2019 this is what many kids think, which is why we still need a month dedicated to the words and deeds of females. Knowing the challenges and achievements of all manner of women history makers, from the big names (I’m looking at you, Amelia Earhart) to the unsung heroes, destroys the false notion that females are mere observers to history. Their stories serve as both inspiration and empowerment: If she could, then I can.

  PLANTING STORIES: The Life of Librarian and Storyteller Pura Belpré (HarperCollins, 40 pp., $17.99; ages 4 to 8)
 </strong>
 beautifully captures the life and essence of Pura Belpré, the first Puerto Rican librarian in New York City. Arriving in Manhattan with the “stories her abuela taught her,” Belpré eventually takes a job at the library as a bilingual assistant. “But where are her abuela’s stories? Not one folk tale from Puerto Rico is on the shelves. How lucky for the library that Pura has story seeds ready to plant and grow.” Belpré goes on to transform library programs through the telling (and eventual publishing) of several culturally diverse stories.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Anika Aldamuy Denise’s intimate telling captures the magical, folk-tale feeling of Belpré’s own stories. Her lyrical text, sprinkled like fairy dust with Spanish words, begs to be read aloud, while Paola Escobar’s stylishly detailed and warmly expressive illustrations capture the joy of sharing stories. But this biography, like all good biographies, does not simply chronicle a life. Beneath all the fun is a valuable message. As Denise writes in her author’s note, Belpré’s life is a “testament to the power of our own stories to build bridges — not just to literacy, but to social change.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Powerful females are not a modern invention. They’ve always been with us, chipping away at society’s restraints and influencing history. Young readers will discover this when they read about Anna Atkins, the subject of Fiona Robinson’s
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  THE BLUEST OF BLUES: Anna Atkins and the First Book of Photographs (Abrams, 48 pp., $17.99; ages 6 to 9).
 </strong>
 Anna is raised by her scientist father, who does not believe gender should limit accomplishment. Not only does he provide Anna with an extraordinary education, but he also encourages her to wonder, question and experiment. And so readers watch Anna grow — with each page turn of this elegantly designed book — from a curious child gathering buttercups in an English meadow in 1807 to a learned botanist who collects, records and renders exquisite and detailed scientific drawings. “But when will she get to share her knowledge of the natural world with the scientific community?” Robinson writes. On this question hangs Anna’s greatest achievement. Barred from the Royal Society of London because she is a woman, Anna finds a way around the limits imposed by society, eventually publishing the world’s first photography book in 1843.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Robinson cleverly renders her illustrations almost exclusively in the cool blue of Anna’s cyanotype photographs. This gives the book a dreamlike quality; Anna’s world feels misty and faded. In fact, much of what we know about Anna has been lost to history. In her author’s note Robinson admits to creating scenes in the first part of the story because of this. This elaboration, of course, makes the book historical fiction, rather than biography. But it is Anna’s deeds that matter here. Her life is one worth knowing. Robinson’s book is one worth reading.

 Wilma Mankiller, who died in 2010, was the first woman chief of the Cherokee Nation, and as most women do who rise to elevated leadership roles, she scrapped and struggled to get there. In
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  WILMA’S WAY HOME: The Life of Wilma Mankiller (Disney-Hyperion, 48 pp., $17.99; ages 7 to 10),
 </strong>
 Doreen Rappaport and Linda Kukuk unfurl Mankiller’s evolution from “dirt poor” child growing up in a society that devalues Native culture into an exemplar of leadership and strength. It is a detailed account, lovingly rendered in Kukuk’s occasionally awkward but enthusiastic artwork, and skillfully told in Rappaport’s clear and accessible prose. But it is the use of Mankiller’s own words, woven throughout the text, that makes this book soar. Hearing her voice gives us a sense of the real woman. When Mankiller says, “Women can help turn the world right side up,” her sincerity resonates, and we can’t help nodding at the wisdom of her words.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 From the first sentence of
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  OUT OF THIS WORLD: The Surreal Art of Leonora Carrington (Balzer + Bray, 40 pp., $17.99; ages 4 to 8),
 </strong>
 written by Michelle Markel and illustrated by Amanda Hall, readers know that the artist Leonora Carrington is a rebel. “Leonora’s parents wanted her to be like every other well-bred English girl,” Markel writes. “But she was not.” Boarding schools and debutante balls could not quash Leonora’s artist spirit, and she heads to art school, then off to Paris and into the orbit of the Surrealists. But it isn’t until she flees to Mexico ahead of the Nazis that Leonora discovers her true artistic voice. Wisely, Hall chooses not to recreate Carrington’s art (which can be brooding and sexually suggestive). Instead, she creates bright, busy spreads filled with enchantment. Hyenas sport wild, black manes (much like Leonora’s own hair). Tortoises peek from pockets. Green potions bubble.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Markel’s telling — evocative and poetic — feels enchanted, too, even if she does occasionally overstate for effect: “Leonora and the other female Surrealists … had no interest in painting women who looked like pretty decorations, as men had done for centuries.” One could argue that artists from Rembrandt to Goya to Millet depicted women as they lived and worked, not just as ornaments. But the author’s point is understood. Carrington’s depiction of women
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  is
 </em>
 singular. And Markel’s gorgeous description of Carrington’s paintings is the perfect summation of the extraordinariness found in all females: In them, “women have special gifts; they can do things beyond anybody’s wildest dreams — which is marvelous, and it’s powerful, and it’s true.”

 We take the weekend to highlight some of the recent books coverage in The Times:
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Our cover review this week is of Nell Freudenberger’s novel “
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/books/review/nell-freudenberger-lost-and-wanted.html?emc=edit_bk_20190405&amp;nl=book-review&amp;nlid=6898248620190405&amp;te=1&amp;module=inline" title="">
  Lost and Wanted
 </a>
 ,” about a quantum physicist in mourning. Our reviewer, Louisa Hall, sung its praises: “Freudenberger navigates complicated concepts from physics with admirable clarity, and those concepts — entanglement, uncertainty, gravitational waves — help us feel in new ways the ongoing influence of dormant friendships, the difficulties involved with believing in attachments that can’t be observed, the enduring pull of discarded hopes.”
</p>

 The first miniature books to enter Patricia J. Pistner’s life were ones she made with paper and a staple gun for her childhood dollhouse many years ago. She placed them on tiny doll tables in tiny doll rooms and read them aloud to tiny dolls. “A house has to have books in it,” she said recently.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 There would be more dollhouses — ones she and her husband built and furnished for his granddaughters, and the now famous Pistner House, a five-and-a-half-foot-high marvel of 18th-century French architecture and design that features perfectly-scaled miniature reproductions, made over half a decade, by 65 artists and artisans. That led to a new obsession. “I made a life-changing decision to put in a library,” Pistner said, “and instead of using faux books I decided I would have real books.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Fast forward a number of years — and a number of courses on antiquarian books, miniature books and the history of bookbinding — to now, when Pistner (pronounced PEIST-ner) has become one of the country’s foremost collectors of miniature books. About 950 books from her collection are currently on display at the Grolier Club,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/arts/design/book-lovers-grolier-club.html?module=inline" title="">
  the nation’s oldest society of bibliophiles
 </a>
 , in Manhattan. (The exhibition, curated by Pistner and Jan Storm van Leeuwen, closes on May 19.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Pistner, 69, sees her tiny books not just as intricately designed, differently scaled versions of things she loves already, but also as important artifacts in the development of books through history, reflecting “the finest examples of various binding styles,” she said.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Most of the books in the exhibit are about one to three inches high and would nestle easily in the palm of your hand. Some are the size of a thumbnail. (There are also a few ultra-micro-miniatures, with no dimension greater than a quarter of an inch; one, shockingly, looks to be about as big as the period in this sentence.) The oldest is a cuneiform tablet from about 2300 B.C.; the newest was published last year. They are

 valued

 in the tens or hundreds or thousands of dollars; the rarest of miniature antiquarian books can sell in the six or even seven figures.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 There are religious books and history books; almanacs and devotionals; picture books and novels and poetry; printed books and handmade manuscripts; collections of Shakespeare and books about the alphabet. Many are elaborately and extravagantly bound, with covers inlaid in materials including gold and silver and jewels. Some were made as exquisite little objects; others were meant to be read frequently, tucked inside a pocket and carried close to their owners’ hearts for ease of consultation.

 , the exhibit takes up just a modest-sized room and hallway. But it turns out that you can fit a lot of teeny books into a relatively small space. A few days before the exhibit opened, Pistner was there to put the finishing touches on the display — she made the tiny stands for her tiny objects herself, out of Vivak plastic-like material — and to talk about her passion for her books.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Asking her to choose favorites is like asking a parent which of their children they love the best, but here are a few highlights from the collection:
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Here, in its original Latin, albeit smaller, is

  Galileo’s famous 1615 letter to Cosimo d’Medici’s mother

 , laying out his (heretical) reasoning for why the Bible should not be used as a basis for scientific belief. The fact that it is printed in 2 pt. “fly’s eye” type — by comparison, the type you are reading now (in the printed newspaper, at least) is 8.7 pt. — makes it all the more exciting. It is considered to be one of the most famous miniature books in the world, Pistner said, because of its size (the binding is 18 millimeters, or about 0.7 of an inch, high) and the quality of its craftsmanship.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 One of two tiny eight-sided Qur’ans in the exhibit, this is a complete transcription of the Islamic holy book, probably from the 19th century. It measures in at a mere 50 x 45 x 12 mm and has fetching gold pigment on its cover and elaborate floral designs inside. “A miniature Qur’an permits a protective intimacy with the revealed word of God through wearing, carrying or close placement,” Pistner writes in the

 . In the Ottoman era, mini Qur’ans were also placed on banners carried into battle.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This very small 2,300-odd-years-old solid-black object is replete with writing, much of it consisting of apparently indecipherable magic spells. But around its sides is a four-line invocation calling on the creator of the universe “to give strength, health and salvation and to protect the wearer from evil and harmful spirits.” Such objects were actually amulets often worn or carried by their owners during the Roman Empire.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The exhibit includes many weird and unusual types of books, including a single sheet of 258 x 7 mm paper on which the Lord’s Prayer has been micrographically inscribed in black ink; a 51 mm tall Ethiopic manuscript from the 19th or early 20th century, written on wooden boards and stored in a two-piece leather case; and a heart-shaped 19th-century possibly-French book that opens into an elaborate puzzle of poetry and prayers. The manuscript above was a diary written, in contravention of Navy rules, by a sailor aboard the transport ship Henry R. Mallory during World War I. (He cunningly concealed it in a little brass nut that may have been part of the ship’s pipe system.) The diary, on a single scrolling sheet of paper, chronicles meetings with enemy submarines, ones that fire at the Mallory and ones that the Mallory fires upon; ones that sink, and ones that get away.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This is a very rare example of the phenomenon known as triple dos-a-dos binding, meaning that three bindings are connected to each other by shared inner covers. In this case, two separate books were bound together by means of various complicated maneuvers in late 18th-century France, with the two parts of the first book, the “Etrennes,” split apart and all of the Almanac concealed inside. When you pick it up, you find it opens like an accordion, in a sense, with one of the books facing toward you and the other facing away.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 2016, a 9-year-old boy, Joseph Gama met Pistner by chance at a meeting of the Miniature Book Society in Texas (he was there with his father). Charmed by his wonder and enthusiasm, Pistner presented Joseph with a miniature book he had particularly admired. “Things I Like,” a compendium of his favorite things, with illustrations by the author, was his thank-you gift to her a little while later. The things Joseph likes, it turns out, include trucks; bicycles; rockets; books; his dog, Astro; and Pistner herself, represented by the words “And You” on the last page of the book, along with instructions to smell the heart he has drawn with a strawberry-scented crayon.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The book here
 <!-- -->
 is presented inside a hollowed-out walnut with a golden inner edge, alongside a thimble and other sewing implements. Such so-called sewing nécessaires were in circulation in France in the 18th and 19th centuries, but it is very rare to find one that contains a teeny book as well the more obvious practical tools. “Valeur et Constance,” or “Value and Constancy,” is a Parisian almanac for the year 1823, and it slips out of its slot and can be read (albeit with some physical maneuvering) even as its owner sews.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This 14th-century book from Damascus contains two complete homilies and a partial one relating to the founding of principles of the Samaritans, the longest-lived religious sect in Jewish history. Written mostly in Arabic with a few passages in Paleo-Hebrew, the book also contains a biblical account of the creation of the world, a great many calls to repent, and various prayers for, among other things, the well-being of the sultan. It is fraying at the edges but its words, in ink on parchment, are still perfectly clear.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Not only is this one of the teeniest manuscripts ever produced by the renowned London bookbinders Sangorski &amp; Sutcliffe, it also contains two of the most stirring speeches in American history: The Gettysburg Address and Lincoln’s Second Inaugural Address. The book was exquisitely handwritten and illuminated around 1930 by Alberto Sangorski, brother of one of the firm’s founders, and includes a tiny painting of Lincoln.
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.biblio.com/blog/2014/12/great-omar-jewel-sangorski-sutcliffe/#" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Founded at the beginning of the 20th century, Sangorski &amp; Sutcliffe
 </a>
 became known for reviving the Middle Ages custom of creating sumptuous jeweled bindings, in which leather covers are elaborately inlaid with gold, silver and precious and semiprecious stones. Its most famous work — a luxurious binding for a (non-miniature) copy of the Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám, which took two and a half years to make and had a front cover decorated with three golden peacocks and inlaid with 1,000 jewels — sadly went down with the Titanic.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The cover of this cunning little almanac is made with, among other things, bloodstone, glass, gold, woven textile and braids of hair, along with the initials A.C. Two gold frames, on the front and the back covers, show a snake biting its tail in an endless circle symbolizing eternity. It is believed such books were given by a person to his or her beloved as a pledge of endless devotion.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 How tiny is this volume? So tiny that it is known as an ultra-micro book, with dimensions of 0.75 x 0.75x 1 mm. So tiny that when you look at it in its display case, what you see is an almost imperceptible black speck in the middle of a tiny circle inside another, slightly larger circle. (

 The version above is enlarged.)

 The book, one of 245 copies printed in Tokyo in 2012, contains printed letters that are .01 mm wide as well as ridiculously small illustrations of 12 types of Japanese flowers found in the four seasons of the year. To help put it in perspective, it is displayed with an enlarged version of the book, with a (relatively) gigantic 13 x 13 mm binding, and an 8x magnifying glass.

 Troubling history lives on, vividly and urgently, in this week’s recommended books. Julián Herbert’s latest book revisits, with “shame and fury,” the massacre of 300 Chinese immigrants in the city of Torreón during the Mexican Revolution. Mark Bowden follows detectives as they crack open a 40-year-old cold case involving the disappearance of two sisters. “The Lions’ Den” examines how thinkers on the left have grappled with the idea and the reality of Israel. And the starkly titled “Hate” is about the history — and the present — of anti-Semitism in France.

 We also look at one of the year’s most highly anticipated novels, “Normal People,” Sally Rooney’s follow-up to “Conversations With Friends,” and at two debut novels: one comic and one terrifying.

 </em>
 Rooney’s second novel, following “Conversations With Friends,” was longlisted for the Man Booker Prize. It’s about Marianne and Connell, gifted teenagers from different social classes in Ireland. The book tracks them across four years. They are never quite boyfriend and girlfriend in the conventional sense. They “merely break each other’s hearts over and over again,” our critic Dwight Garner writes. Rooney’s “intimate and pared-down style can be reminiscent of Rachel Cusk’s,” Garner says, and her novels are satisfying “because there aren’t dueling narrators or cat’s cradles of plotlines. You buy Rooney’s ticket, you take her ride.”

 The latest by Herbert, a Mexican writer and musician, tells the story of a massacre that took place in the city of Torreón, over the course of three days in 1911, during the Mexican Revolution. Three hundred Chinese immigrants were shot and bludgeoned to death in the streets. The crime has been misunderstood and misrepresented. But it has never been truly forgotten. Our critic Parul Sehgal writes: “The great strength of Herbert’s book, written with such shame and fury, is that it is not framed as epitaph but as dispatch from a live crime scene, attentive to the silences, the still seething resentments, relinquishing nothing to history.”

 Prosecutors, often hoping for higher office, have embraced a tough-on-crime stance that gives them undue power, according to this riveting argument by a staff writer at The Times Magazine — at once an indictment and a call for reform. Bazelon persuasively indicts prosecutorial excess, arguing that the lawyers who work in the more than 2,000 prosecutors’ offices around the country bear much of the responsibility for over-incarceration, conviction of the innocent and other serious problems of the criminal justice system.

 In this thoughtful, stirring true-crime tale, Bowden follows cold-case detectives as they crack a 40-year-old case involving the disappearance of two Maryland sisters — a story he covered at the time as a young reporter. Bowden shows how even the most exquisitely pulled-off interrogations are a messy business, in which exhaustive strategizing is followed by game-time gut decisions and endless second-guessing and soul-searching.

 Linfield tackles the fraught question of how Jewish thinkers of the left, devoted to universal values, contend with Israel, a country founded to solve the particularist problem of Jewish sovereignty. The heart of the book is a series of individual portraits of iconic, midcentury left-wing thinkers who wrote extensively on the idea and reality of Jewish statehood. Linfield is an associate professor of journalism at New York University and her writing combines the storytelling of a journalist with a scholar’s analysis of ideas.

This impassioned book swirls from personal to historical reflections, setting out to understand the reasons for the scourge and to cut through what he sees as persistent French obfuscation of it.

It’s a fresh take on Kafka, highlighting the potential for terrifying change that may lurk in our DNA. Lee explores themes of illness and the almost dystopian alienation that emerges between sufferers and the well, and does so with artfulness and delicious doses of body horror and contemporary British social satire.

 Bazelon, a staff writer at The New York Times Magazine, argues that prosecutors have far too much power over the outcomes of criminal cases. To explore their outsize influence, Bazelon follows the cases of two defendants, and interweaves their stories with academic research. The book lays out a path for urgent and necessary changes to the current system, and features a group of young, reform-minded district attorneys who give Bazelon hope.

 McKibben sounded an early alarm about climate change, and his new book’s subtitle summarizes what is perhaps his worst fear. He outlines the many dangers that climate change poses to civilization — rising sea levels, threats to food production — and the obstacles to halting the onset of global warming. While fear outweighs hope in the book, he does offer some reasons to be optimistic.

 As a cub reporter in Baltimore, Bowden was swept up in a 1975 case of two missing sisters, which went unsolved for decades. In 2013, the police trained their eyes on a new suspect, and Bowden, also the author of “Black Hawk Down,” followed along as they investigated. His book revisits the case and offers insight into the interrogation practices and the high stakes that accompany them.

 Rooney’s first novel, “Conversations With Friends,” became a sensation, praised for its portrayal of a complex, intellectually driven friendship between two young women. With her trademark nuance and insight, her new book follows the on-again, off-again romance and friendship between Connell and Marianne. The pair first meet as high schoolers, striking up an unlikely relationship — he’s popular and well-liked; she’s a loner — and later attend Trinity College in Dublin together.

 As a Filipino child growing up in a small Massachusetts town, Grace Talusan felt both scrutinized and unseen. Having arrived from the Philippines when she was 2, she rehearsed a Boston accent and prayed for a metamorphosis, pleading with God to turn her into a white girl with blonde hair and blue eyes. But her transformation one morning at the age of 8 turned out to be less Barbie and more Kafka: “My lips had disappeared into a mass of swollen flesh, my earlobes were triple their usual size and my cheeks were throbbing hot.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In “The Body Papers,” Talusan’s precise, delicately constructed memoir-in-essays, her brief turn as a “puffy pink monster,” inflamed with hives, was a sign that something monstrous was being done to her. Her father’s father, Tatang (Tagalog for “father” — Talusan uses the Filipino vocabulary for kinship ties throughout), would arrive from the Philippines for an extended visit every spring and enter Grace’s room at night, pulling her floral nightgown over her shoulders. The sexual abuse started when she was 7 and ended when she was 13, after she waited for Tatang one evening and shoved him into the bedroom wall. Seeing the look of humiliation on his face, she knew that one form of torment was over: “My rage turned to joy.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “The Body Papers” doesn’t track a one-way march to triumph from adversity; Talusan’s essays loop in on themselves, as she retrieves old memories and finds unexpected points of connection. It was only a few years after the abuse stopped that she told her family about it. They were supportive but not surprised. Her grandfather, she learned, “was an unrelenting pedophile.” Her parents were compulsively secretive, having fled an authoritarian country where “a story could get you killed.” After her father’s student visa expired, the Talusans became undocumented immigrants; Grace and her older sister only found out about their vulnerable status when they had to miss school for the blood tests and fingerprinting that were part of the immigration application process.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “There is no paper trail to document what happened to my body,” Talusan writes, recalling what her grandfather did to her. But once an order for her deportation arrived, a paper trail controlled her fate. She later obtained her immigration file through a Freedom of Information Act request and reproduces some of the pages in this book, as if entering them into the public record. “With a shuffle of papers,” she writes, “life as I knew it could be lost.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Talusan is now an American citizen, though soon after President Trump’s inauguration she started carrying her American passport with her whenever she left the house. Documents had once posed a threat; now they were a form of protection. When she took a genetic test at the age of 33, the slip of paper showing the results saved her life. Learning that she was genetically predisposed to the cancers that had killed a number of her female relatives, Talusan decided to have her breasts and ovaries removed.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 These were radical interventions for a body that had suffered from years of neglect. “I once drew a picture of myself in which my head floats over my body like a balloon,” she writes. “That’s where I really live, my head; my body is just the vehicle.” She put on weight, trying to erect a protective barrier around herself. But the boundary between her and the world had a way of warping and dissolving.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Talusan describes such experiences with unadorned prose that conveys a startling specificity. As an anxious child, she would bite her nails “and line up the white slivers in the groove of the pencil holder, pretending my nails were sails for boats that would take me away.” After her double mastectomy, she imagined what would happen if she went jogging and her silicone implants burst out of her skin: “I saw myself stooping to collect the slippery implants, and quickly dusting off the black pebbles from the track before anyone saw.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Her father, an ophthalmologist, was so preoccupied with external dangers to his loved ones’ eyesight (Grace learned to respect “the raw power of drinking straws, metal clothes hangers, baseballs, pencils and tree branches”) that he missed the signs that a young granddaughter, Grace’s niece, was developing a retinoblastoma — a cancer of the eye. His misplaced vigilance was also what led him to miss the signs that his own daughter was being abused inside the family home.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Our house was American on the outside, but Filipino on the inside,” Talusan recalls. It was supposed to be a haven; a place where she could remove the mask that she had worn all day, as one of the few girls of color in her school. Decades later, when she temporarily moved with her husband to the Philippines for a fellowship, she wondered if returning to the land of her birth, a place where she could blend into the crowd, would alleviate the sense of loss that seemed to follow her wherever she went.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But even though she lived in a cosseted part of Manila, in a neighborhood with a Starbucks and a Lamborghini dealership, she knew that the poor were hauling garbage and scrounging for food on the other side of the wall. Visiting an orphanage, she met a teenage girl who had been found in a cemetery, having survived for years on the oranges and pastries that mourners left on the gravestones, in honor of the dead. “Every day here,” Talusan writes, “I am offended.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Such commentary, while righteous and earned, is not the point of this indelible book. Talusan has the instincts of a storyteller, teasing out her narrative through images and allusion. She writes about her father with tenderness and empathy, recalling how he used to earn extra money in the Philippines by making prosthetic eyes that he boiled in a stockpot filled with water. “He thought it was beautiful, how the eyes bobbed and floated and rolled over — all those eyes that couldn’t see.”
