 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 Eaton DC, 1201 K Street NW Washington DC, 202-289-7600;

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .


 
  [Read The New York Times
 
 
  
   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 Eaton DC, 1201 K Street NW Washington DC, 202-289-7600;

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .


 
  [Read The New York Times
 
 
  
   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

  history of the Brooklyn Bridge and about
 
 
  
   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .


 
  [Read The New York Times
 
 
  
   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

  history of the Brooklyn Bridge and about
 
 
  
   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .


 
  [Read The New York Times
 
 
  
   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

  history of the Brooklyn Bridge and about
 
 
  
   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Lucas Rodriguez had a goal and an assist and D.C. United scored three times within a nine-minute span to beat the Colorado Rapids 3-2 on Saturday night.


 Luciano Acosta tied it at 1 in the 35th minute with a left-footed rocket into the roof on the net.


 Chris Durkin gave United (4-1-2) the lead three minutes later, finishing Rodriguez's pass from a narrow angle. It was the 19-year-old's first professional goal.


 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.


 Kei Kamara scored on a header in the 66th minute to cut it to 3-2. Benny Feilhaber gave the Rapids (0-5-2) the lead in the 11th minute with a shot from the left side of the 6-yard box.

 D.C. United moved a point ahead of the Columbus Crew for first place in the Eastern Conference.


 Colorado lost its fourth in a row.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .


 
  [Read The New York Times
 
 
  
   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

  history of the Brooklyn Bridge and about
 
 
  
   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Lucas Rodriguez had a goal and an assist and D.C. United scored three times within a nine-minute span to beat the Colorado Rapids 3-2 on Saturday night.


 Luciano Acosta tied it at 1 in the 35th minute with a left-footed rocket into the roof on the net.


 Chris Durkin gave United (4-1-2) the lead three minutes later, finishing Rodriguez's pass from a narrow angle. It was the 19-year-old's first professional goal.


 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.


 Kei Kamara scored on a header in the 66th minute to cut it to 3-2. Benny Feilhaber gave the Rapids (0-5-2) the lead in the 11th minute with a shot from the left side of the 6-yard box.

 D.C. United moved a point ahead of the Columbus Crew for first place in the Eastern Conference.


 Colorado lost its fourth in a row.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .


 
  [Read The New York Times
 
 
  
   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

   Peter J. Tomasi’s graphic
  
 
 
  
   novel
  
 
 
  history of the Brooklyn Bridge and about
 
 
  
   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 The hero’s journey to this milestone is filled with many memorable moments, from his debut, to Robin’s and Batgirl’s and more.

 
  This cover of Detective Comics No. 1000, drawn by Nicola Scott and colored by Annette Kwok, will be sold at King's Comics in Sydney, Australia. Scott, who is Australian, described the cover as “a class photo, Batman through the decades.”

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .


 
  [Read The New York Times
 
 
  
   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

   Peter J. Tomasi’s graphic
  
 
 
  
   novel
  
 
 
  history of the Brooklyn Bridge and about
 
 
  
   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Lucas Rodriguez had a goal and an assist and D.C. United scored three times within a nine-minute span to beat the Colorado Rapids 3-2 on Saturday night.


 Luciano Acosta tied it at 1 in the 35th minute with a left-footed rocket into the roof on the net.


 Chris Durkin gave United (4-1-2) the lead three minutes later, finishing Rodriguez's pass from a narrow angle. It was the 19-year-old's first professional goal.


 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.


 Kei Kamara scored on a header in the 66th minute to cut it to 3-2. Benny Feilhaber gave the Rapids (0-5-2) the lead in the 11th minute with a shot from the left side of the 6-yard box.

 D.C. United moved a point ahead of the Columbus Crew for first place in the Eastern Conference.


 Colorado lost its fourth in a row.

 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.

   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 The hero’s journey to this milestone is filled with many memorable moments, from his debut, to Robin’s and Batgirl’s and more.

 
  This cover of Detective Comics No. 1000, drawn by Nicola Scott and colored by Annette Kwok, will be sold at King's Comics in Sydney, Australia. Scott, who is Australian, described the cover as “a class photo, Batman through the decades.”

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .


 
  [Read The New York Times
 
 
  
   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

  history of the Brooklyn Bridge and about
 
 
  
   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Lucas Rodriguez had a goal and an assist and D.C. United scored three times within a nine-minute span to beat the Colorado Rapids 3-2 on Saturday night.


 Luciano Acosta tied it at 1 in the 35th minute with a left-footed rocket into the roof on the net.


 Chris Durkin gave United (4-1-2) the lead three minutes later, finishing Rodriguez's pass from a narrow angle. It was the 19-year-old's first professional goal.


 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.


 Kei Kamara scored on a header in the 66th minute to cut it to 3-2. Benny Feilhaber gave the Rapids (0-5-2) the lead in the 11th minute with a shot from the left side of the 6-yard box.

 D.C. United moved a point ahead of the Columbus Crew for first place in the Eastern Conference.


 Colorado lost its fourth in a row.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 The hero’s journey to this milestone is filled with many memorable moments, from his debut, to Robin’s and Batgirl’s and more.

 
  This cover of Detective Comics No. 1000, drawn by Nicola Scott and colored by Annette Kwok, will be sold at King's Comics in Sydney, Australia. Scott, who is Australian, described the cover as “a class photo, Batman through the decades.”

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .


 
  [Read The New York Times
 
 
  
   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

  history of the Brooklyn Bridge and about
 
 
  
   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Lucas Rodriguez had a goal and an assist and D.C. United scored three times within a nine-minute span to beat the Colorado Rapids 3-2 on Saturday night.


 Luciano Acosta tied it at 1 in the 35th minute with a left-footed rocket into the roof on the net.


 Chris Durkin gave United (4-1-2) the lead three minutes later, finishing Rodriguez's pass from a narrow angle. It was the 19-year-old's first professional goal.


 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.


 Kei Kamara scored on a header in the 66th minute to cut it to 3-2. Benny Feilhaber gave the Rapids (0-5-2) the lead in the 11th minute with a shot from the left side of the 6-yard box.

 D.C. United moved a point ahead of the Columbus Crew for first place in the Eastern Conference.


 Colorado lost its fourth in a row.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 The hero’s journey to this milestone is filled with many memorable moments, from his debut, to Robin’s and Batgirl’s and more.

 
  This cover of Detective Comics No. 1000, drawn by Nicola Scott and colored by Annette Kwok, will be sold at King's Comics in Sydney, Australia. Scott, who is Australian, described the cover as “a class photo, Batman through the decades.”

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .


 
  [Read The New York Times
 
 
  
   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

  history of the Brooklyn Bridge and about
 
 
  
   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Lucas Rodriguez had a goal and an assist and D.C. United scored three times within a nine-minute span to beat the Colorado Rapids 3-2 on Saturday night.


 Luciano Acosta tied it at 1 in the 35th minute with a left-footed rocket into the roof on the net.


 Chris Durkin gave United (4-1-2) the lead three minutes later, finishing Rodriguez's pass from a narrow angle. It was the 19-year-old's first professional goal.


 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.


 Kei Kamara scored on a header in the 66th minute to cut it to 3-2. Benny Feilhaber gave the Rapids (0-5-2) the lead in the 11th minute with a shot from the left side of the 6-yard box.

 D.C. United moved a point ahead of the Columbus Crew for first place in the Eastern Conference.


 Colorado lost its fourth in a row.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .

   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

  history of the Brooklyn Bridge and about
 
 
  
   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

   Marvel Studios’ woman problem
  
 
 
  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Lucas Rodriguez had a goal and an assist and D.C. United scored three times within a nine-minute span to beat the Colorado Rapids 3-2 on Saturday night.


 Luciano Acosta tied it at 1 in the 35th minute with a left-footed rocket into the roof on the net.


 Chris Durkin gave United (4-1-2) the lead three minutes later, finishing Rodriguez's pass from a narrow angle. It was the 19-year-old's first professional goal.


 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.


 Kei Kamara scored on a header in the 66th minute to cut it to 3-2. Benny Feilhaber gave the Rapids (0-5-2) the lead in the 11th minute with a shot from the left side of the 6-yard box.

 D.C. United moved a point ahead of the Columbus Crew for first place in the Eastern Conference.


 Colorado lost its fourth in a row.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .

   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

  history of the Brooklyn Bridge and about
 
 
  
   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

   Marvel Studios’ woman problem
  
 
 
  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Lucas Rodriguez had a goal and an assist and D.C. United scored three times within a nine-minute span to beat the Colorado Rapids 3-2 on Saturday night.


 Luciano Acosta tied it at 1 in the 35th minute with a left-footed rocket into the roof on the net.


 Chris Durkin gave United (4-1-2) the lead three minutes later, finishing Rodriguez's pass from a narrow angle. It was the 19-year-old's first professional goal.


 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.


 Kei Kamara scored on a header in the 66th minute to cut it to 3-2. Benny Feilhaber gave the Rapids (0-5-2) the lead in the 11th minute with a shot from the left side of the 6-yard box.

 D.C. United moved a point ahead of the Columbus Crew for first place in the Eastern Conference.


 Colorado lost its fourth in a row.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .

  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

  history of the Brooklyn Bridge and about
 
 
  
   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

   Marvel Studios’ woman problem
  
 
 
  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Lucas Rodriguez had a goal and an assist and D.C. United scored three times within a nine-minute span to beat the Colorado Rapids 3-2 on Saturday night.


 Luciano Acosta tied it at 1 in the 35th minute with a left-footed rocket into the roof on the net.


 Chris Durkin gave United (4-1-2) the lead three minutes later, finishing Rodriguez's pass from a narrow angle. It was the 19-year-old's first professional goal.


 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.


 Kei Kamara scored on a header in the 66th minute to cut it to 3-2. Benny Feilhaber gave the Rapids (0-5-2) the lead in the 11th minute with a shot from the left side of the 6-yard box.

 D.C. United moved a point ahead of the Columbus Crew for first place in the Eastern Conference.


 Colorado lost its fourth in a row.

 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .

  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray

 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Lucas Rodriguez had a goal and an assist and D.C. United scored three times within a nine-minute span to beat the Colorado Rapids 3-2 on Saturday night.


 Luciano Acosta tied it at 1 in the 35th minute with a left-footed rocket into the roof on the net.


 Chris Durkin gave United (4-1-2) the lead three minutes later, finishing Rodriguez's pass from a narrow angle. It was the 19-year-old's first professional goal.


 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.


 Kei Kamara scored on a header in the 66th minute to cut it to 3-2. Benny Feilhaber gave the Rapids (0-5-2) the lead in the 11th minute with a shot from the left side of the 6-yard box.

 D.C. United moved a point ahead of the Columbus Crew for first place in the Eastern Conference.


 Colorado lost its fourth in a row.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.

 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.

  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.


 Kei Kamara scored on a header in the 66th minute to cut it to 3-2. Benny Feilhaber gave the Rapids (0-5-2) the lead in the 11th minute with a shot from the left side of the 6-yard box.

 D.C. United moved a point ahead of the Columbus Crew for first place in the Eastern Conference.


 Colorado lost its fourth in a row.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan

 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.

 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Chris Durkin gave United (4-1-2) the lead three minutes later, finishing Rodriguez's pass from a narrow angle. It was the 19-year-old's first professional goal.


 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.


 Kei Kamara scored on a header in the 66th minute to cut it to 3-2. Benny Feilhaber gave the Rapids (0-5-2) the lead in the 11th minute with a shot from the left side of the 6-yard box.

 D.C. United moved a point ahead of the Columbus Crew for first place in the Eastern Conference.


 Colorado lost its fourth in a row.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Chris Durkin gave United (4-1-2) the lead three minutes later, finishing Rodriguez's pass from a narrow angle. It was the 19-year-old's first professional goal.


 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.

  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

  many iterations of the Batmobile

  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .

  Batman television series

  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker.

National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Lucas Rodriguez had a goal and an assist and D.C. United scored three times within a nine-minute span to beat the Colorado Rapids 3-2 on Saturday night.


 Luciano Acosta tied it at 1 in the 35th minute with a left-footed rocket into the roof on the net.


 Chris Durkin gave United (4-1-2) the lead three minutes later, finishing Rodriguez's pass from a narrow angle. It was the 19-year-old's first professional goal.


 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.


 Kei Kamara scored on a header in the 66th minute to cut it to 3-2. Benny Feilhaber gave the Rapids (0-5-2) the lead in the 11th minute with a shot from the left side of the 6-yard box.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .

   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

  history of the Brooklyn Bridge and about
 
 
  
   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film

Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .


 
  [Read The New York Times
 
 
  
   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

  history of the Brooklyn Bridge and about
 
 
  
   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.

  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.

 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Lucas Rodriguez had a goal and an assist and D.C. United scored three times within a nine-minute span to beat the Colorado Rapids 3-2 on Saturday night.


 Luciano Acosta tied it at 1 in the 35th minute with a left-footed rocket into the roof on the net.


 Chris Durkin gave United (4-1-2) the lead three minutes later, finishing Rodriguez's pass from a narrow angle. It was the 19-year-old's first professional goal.


 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.


 Kei Kamara scored on a header in the 66th minute to cut it to 3-2. Benny Feilhaber gave the Rapids (0-5-2) the lead in the 11th minute with a shot from the left side of the 6-yard box.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

   Marvel Studios’ woman problem
  
 
 
  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Lucas Rodriguez had a goal and an assist and D.C. United scored three times within a nine-minute span to beat the Colorado Rapids 3-2 on Saturday night.


 Luciano Acosta tied it at 1 in the 35th minute with a left-footed rocket into the roof on the net.


 Chris Durkin gave United (4-1-2) the lead three minutes later, finishing Rodriguez's pass from a narrow angle. It was the 19-year-old's first professional goal.


 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010

  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.

She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Lucas Rodriguez had a goal and an assist and D.C. United scored three times within a nine-minute span to beat the Colorado Rapids 3-2 on Saturday night.


 Luciano Acosta tied it at 1 in the 35th minute with a left-footed rocket into the roof on the net.


 Chris Durkin gave United (4-1-2) the lead three minutes later, finishing Rodriguez's pass from a narrow angle. It was the 19-year-old's first professional goal.


 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.


 Kei Kamara scored on a header in the 66th minute to cut it to 3-2. Benny Feilhaber gave the Rapids (0-5-2) the lead in the 11th minute with a shot from the left side of the 6-yard box.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .


 
  [Read The New York Times
 
 
  
   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .


 
  [Read The New York Times
 
 
  
   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

  history of the Brooklyn Bridge and about
 
 
  
   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Lucas Rodriguez had a goal and an assist and D.C. United scored three times within a nine-minute span to beat the Colorado Rapids 3-2 on Saturday night.


 Luciano Acosta tied it at 1 in the 35th minute with a left-footed rocket into the roof on the net.


 Chris Durkin gave United (4-1-2) the lead three minutes later, finishing Rodriguez's pass from a narrow angle. It was the 19-year-old's first professional goal.


 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.


 Kei Kamara scored on a header in the 66th minute to cut it to 3-2. Benny Feilhaber gave the Rapids (0-5-2) the lead in the 11th minute with a shot from the left side of the 6-yard box.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

   Marvel Studios’ woman problem
  
 
 
  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .

   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 Eaton DC, 1201 K Street NW Washington DC, 202-289-7600;

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .

   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

   Marvel Studios’ woman problem
  
 
 
  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .

   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .

   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 Eaton DC, 1201 K Street NW Washington DC, 202-289-7600;

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .

   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.


 Kei Kamara scored on a header in the 66th minute to cut it to 3-2. Benny Feilhaber gave the Rapids (0-5-2) the lead in the 11th minute with a shot from the left side of the 6-yard box.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 Eaton DC, 1201 K Street NW Washington DC, 202-289-7600;

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .

   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 Eaton DC, 1201 K Street NW Washington DC, 202-289-7600;

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .


 
  [Read The New York Times
 
 
  
   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

  history of the Brooklyn Bridge and about
 
 
  
   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .


 
  [Read The New York Times
 
 
  
   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

  history of the Brooklyn Bridge and about
 
 
  
   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .


 
  [Read The New York Times
 
 
  
   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

  history of the Brooklyn Bridge and about
 
 
  
   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Lucas Rodriguez had a goal and an assist and D.C. United scored three times within a nine-minute span to beat the Colorado Rapids 3-2 on Saturday night.


 Luciano Acosta tied it at 1 in the 35th minute with a left-footed rocket into the roof on the net.


 Chris Durkin gave United (4-1-2) the lead three minutes later, finishing Rodriguez's pass from a narrow angle. It was the 19-year-old's first professional goal.


 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.


 Kei Kamara scored on a header in the 66th minute to cut it to 3-2. Benny Feilhaber gave the Rapids (0-5-2) the lead in the 11th minute with a shot from the left side of the 6-yard box.

 D.C. United moved a point ahead of the Columbus Crew for first place in the Eastern Conference.


 Colorado lost its fourth in a row.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .


 
  [Read The New York Times
 
 
  
   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

  history of the Brooklyn Bridge and about
 
 
  
   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Lucas Rodriguez had a goal and an assist and D.C. United scored three times within a nine-minute span to beat the Colorado Rapids 3-2 on Saturday night.


 Luciano Acosta tied it at 1 in the 35th minute with a left-footed rocket into the roof on the net.


 Chris Durkin gave United (4-1-2) the lead three minutes later, finishing Rodriguez's pass from a narrow angle. It was the 19-year-old's first professional goal.


 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.


 Kei Kamara scored on a header in the 66th minute to cut it to 3-2. Benny Feilhaber gave the Rapids (0-5-2) the lead in the 11th minute with a shot from the left side of the 6-yard box.

 D.C. United moved a point ahead of the Columbus Crew for first place in the Eastern Conference.


 Colorado lost its fourth in a row.

 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .


 
  [Read The New York Times
 
 
  
   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

   Peter J. Tomasi’s graphic
  
 
 
  
   novel
  
 
 
  history of the Brooklyn Bridge and about
 
 
  
   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 The hero’s journey to this milestone is filled with many memorable moments, from his debut, to Robin’s and Batgirl’s and more.

 
  This cover of Detective Comics No. 1000, drawn by Nicola Scott and colored by Annette Kwok, will be sold at King's Comics in Sydney, Australia. Scott, who is Australian, described the cover as “a class photo, Batman through the decades.”

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .


 
  [Read The New York Times
 
 
  
   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

   Peter J. Tomasi’s graphic
  
 
 
  
   novel
  
 
 
  history of the Brooklyn Bridge and about
 
 
  
   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Lucas Rodriguez had a goal and an assist and D.C. United scored three times within a nine-minute span to beat the Colorado Rapids 3-2 on Saturday night.


 Luciano Acosta tied it at 1 in the 35th minute with a left-footed rocket into the roof on the net.


 Chris Durkin gave United (4-1-2) the lead three minutes later, finishing Rodriguez's pass from a narrow angle. It was the 19-year-old's first professional goal.


 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.


 Kei Kamara scored on a header in the 66th minute to cut it to 3-2. Benny Feilhaber gave the Rapids (0-5-2) the lead in the 11th minute with a shot from the left side of the 6-yard box.

 D.C. United moved a point ahead of the Columbus Crew for first place in the Eastern Conference.


 Colorado lost its fourth in a row.

 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.

   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 The hero’s journey to this milestone is filled with many memorable moments, from his debut, to Robin’s and Batgirl’s and more.

 
  This cover of Detective Comics No. 1000, drawn by Nicola Scott and colored by Annette Kwok, will be sold at King's Comics in Sydney, Australia. Scott, who is Australian, described the cover as “a class photo, Batman through the decades.”

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .


 
  [Read The New York Times
 
 
  
   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

  history of the Brooklyn Bridge and about
 
 
  
   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Lucas Rodriguez had a goal and an assist and D.C. United scored three times within a nine-minute span to beat the Colorado Rapids 3-2 on Saturday night.


 Luciano Acosta tied it at 1 in the 35th minute with a left-footed rocket into the roof on the net.


 Chris Durkin gave United (4-1-2) the lead three minutes later, finishing Rodriguez's pass from a narrow angle. It was the 19-year-old's first professional goal.


 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.


 Kei Kamara scored on a header in the 66th minute to cut it to 3-2. Benny Feilhaber gave the Rapids (0-5-2) the lead in the 11th minute with a shot from the left side of the 6-yard box.

 D.C. United moved a point ahead of the Columbus Crew for first place in the Eastern Conference.


 Colorado lost its fourth in a row.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 The hero’s journey to this milestone is filled with many memorable moments, from his debut, to Robin’s and Batgirl’s and more.

 
  This cover of Detective Comics No. 1000, drawn by Nicola Scott and colored by Annette Kwok, will be sold at King's Comics in Sydney, Australia. Scott, who is Australian, described the cover as “a class photo, Batman through the decades.”

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .


 
  [Read The New York Times
 
 
  
   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

  history of the Brooklyn Bridge and about
 
 
  
   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Lucas Rodriguez had a goal and an assist and D.C. United scored three times within a nine-minute span to beat the Colorado Rapids 3-2 on Saturday night.


 Luciano Acosta tied it at 1 in the 35th minute with a left-footed rocket into the roof on the net.


 Chris Durkin gave United (4-1-2) the lead three minutes later, finishing Rodriguez's pass from a narrow angle. It was the 19-year-old's first professional goal.


 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.


 Kei Kamara scored on a header in the 66th minute to cut it to 3-2. Benny Feilhaber gave the Rapids (0-5-2) the lead in the 11th minute with a shot from the left side of the 6-yard box.

 D.C. United moved a point ahead of the Columbus Crew for first place in the Eastern Conference.


 Colorado lost its fourth in a row.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 The hero’s journey to this milestone is filled with many memorable moments, from his debut, to Robin’s and Batgirl’s and more.

 
  This cover of Detective Comics No. 1000, drawn by Nicola Scott and colored by Annette Kwok, will be sold at King's Comics in Sydney, Australia. Scott, who is Australian, described the cover as “a class photo, Batman through the decades.”

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .


 
  [Read The New York Times
 
 
  
   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

  history of the Brooklyn Bridge and about
 
 
  
   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Lucas Rodriguez had a goal and an assist and D.C. United scored three times within a nine-minute span to beat the Colorado Rapids 3-2 on Saturday night.


 Luciano Acosta tied it at 1 in the 35th minute with a left-footed rocket into the roof on the net.


 Chris Durkin gave United (4-1-2) the lead three minutes later, finishing Rodriguez's pass from a narrow angle. It was the 19-year-old's first professional goal.


 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.


 Kei Kamara scored on a header in the 66th minute to cut it to 3-2. Benny Feilhaber gave the Rapids (0-5-2) the lead in the 11th minute with a shot from the left side of the 6-yard box.

 D.C. United moved a point ahead of the Columbus Crew for first place in the Eastern Conference.


 Colorado lost its fourth in a row.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .

   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

  history of the Brooklyn Bridge and about
 
 
  
   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

   Marvel Studios’ woman problem
  
 
 
  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Lucas Rodriguez had a goal and an assist and D.C. United scored three times within a nine-minute span to beat the Colorado Rapids 3-2 on Saturday night.


 Luciano Acosta tied it at 1 in the 35th minute with a left-footed rocket into the roof on the net.


 Chris Durkin gave United (4-1-2) the lead three minutes later, finishing Rodriguez's pass from a narrow angle. It was the 19-year-old's first professional goal.


 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.


 Kei Kamara scored on a header in the 66th minute to cut it to 3-2. Benny Feilhaber gave the Rapids (0-5-2) the lead in the 11th minute with a shot from the left side of the 6-yard box.

 D.C. United moved a point ahead of the Columbus Crew for first place in the Eastern Conference.


 Colorado lost its fourth in a row.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .

   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

  history of the Brooklyn Bridge and about
 
 
  
   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

   Marvel Studios’ woman problem
  
 
 
  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Lucas Rodriguez had a goal and an assist and D.C. United scored three times within a nine-minute span to beat the Colorado Rapids 3-2 on Saturday night.


 Luciano Acosta tied it at 1 in the 35th minute with a left-footed rocket into the roof on the net.


 Chris Durkin gave United (4-1-2) the lead three minutes later, finishing Rodriguez's pass from a narrow angle. It was the 19-year-old's first professional goal.


 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.


 Kei Kamara scored on a header in the 66th minute to cut it to 3-2. Benny Feilhaber gave the Rapids (0-5-2) the lead in the 11th minute with a shot from the left side of the 6-yard box.

 D.C. United moved a point ahead of the Columbus Crew for first place in the Eastern Conference.


 Colorado lost its fourth in a row.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.

  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.

   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray

 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Lucas Rodriguez had a goal and an assist and D.C. United scored three times within a nine-minute span to beat the Colorado Rapids 3-2 on Saturday night.


 Luciano Acosta tied it at 1 in the 35th minute with a left-footed rocket into the roof on the net.


 Chris Durkin gave United (4-1-2) the lead three minutes later, finishing Rodriguez's pass from a narrow angle. It was the 19-year-old's first professional goal.


 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.


 Kei Kamara scored on a header in the 66th minute to cut it to 3-2. Benny Feilhaber gave the Rapids (0-5-2) the lead in the 11th minute with a shot from the left side of the 6-yard box.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

   Marvel Studios’ woman problem
  
 
 
  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.

  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as

 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Lucas Rodriguez had a goal and an assist and D.C. United scored three times within a nine-minute span to beat the Colorado Rapids 3-2 on Saturday night.


 Luciano Acosta tied it at 1 in the 35th minute with a left-footed rocket into the roof on the net.


 Chris Durkin gave United (4-1-2) the lead three minutes later, finishing Rodriguez's pass from a narrow angle. It was the 19-year-old's first professional goal.


 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.


 Kei Kamara scored on a header in the 66th minute to cut it to 3-2. Benny Feilhaber gave the Rapids (0-5-2) the lead in the 11th minute with a shot from the left side of the 6-yard box.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .

   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

  history of the Brooklyn Bridge and about
 
 
  
   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”

Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .


 
  [Read The New York Times
 
 
  
   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

   novel
  
 
 
  history of the Brooklyn Bridge and about
 
 
  
   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.

 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.

 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing

 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian

 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker.

 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Lucas Rodriguez had a goal and an assist and D.C. United scored three times within a nine-minute span to beat the Colorado Rapids 3-2 on Saturday night.


 Luciano Acosta tied it at 1 in the 35th minute with a left-footed rocket into the roof on the net.


 Chris Durkin gave United (4-1-2) the lead three minutes later, finishing Rodriguez's pass from a narrow angle. It was the 19-year-old's first professional goal.


 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.


 Kei Kamara scored on a header in the 66th minute to cut it to 3-2. Benny Feilhaber gave the Rapids (0-5-2) the lead in the 11th minute with a shot from the left side of the 6-yard box.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Lucas Rodriguez had a goal and an assist and D.C. United scored three times within a nine-minute span to beat the Colorado Rapids 3-2 on Saturday night.


 Luciano Acosta tied it at 1 in the 35th minute with a left-footed rocket into the roof on the net.


 Chris Durkin gave United (4-1-2) the lead three minutes later, finishing Rodriguez's pass from a narrow angle. It was the 19-year-old's first professional goal.


 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .

   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups

  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .


 
  [Read The New York Times
 
 
  
   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

  history of the Brooklyn Bridge and about
 
 
  
   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of

   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray

 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.

 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.


 Kei Kamara scored on a header in the 66th minute to cut it to 3-2. Benny Feilhaber gave the Rapids (0-5-2) the lead in the 11th minute with a shot from the left side of the 6-yard box.

 D.C. United moved a point ahead of the Columbus Crew for first place in the Eastern Conference.


 Colorado lost its fourth in a row.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.

  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher

  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the

 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  in “Captain Marvel.” | Can the movie solve
 
 
  
   Marvel Studios’ woman problem
  
 
 
  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Lucas Rodriguez had a goal and an assist and D.C. United scored three times within a nine-minute span to beat the Colorado Rapids 3-2 on Saturday night.


 Luciano Acosta tied it at 1 in the 35th minute with a left-footed rocket into the roof on the net.


 Chris Durkin gave United (4-1-2) the lead three minutes later, finishing Rodriguez's pass from a narrow angle. It was the 19-year-old's first professional goal.


 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.


 Kei Kamara scored on a header in the 66th minute to cut it to 3-2. Benny Feilhaber gave the Rapids (0-5-2) the lead in the 11th minute with a shot from the left side of the 6-yard box.

 D.C. United moved a point ahead of the Columbus Crew for first place in the Eastern Conference.


 Colorado lost its fourth in a row.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.

   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.

 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”

  Leslie Thompkins

 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.

 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.

 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo

  Slam Bradley
 
 (

 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  in “Captain Marvel.” | Can the movie solve
 
 
  
   Marvel Studios’ woman problem
  
 
 
  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Lucas Rodriguez had a goal and an assist and D.C. United scored three times within a nine-minute span to beat the Colorado Rapids 3-2 on Saturday night.


 Luciano Acosta tied it at 1 in the 35th minute with a left-footed rocket into the roof on the net.


 Chris Durkin gave United (4-1-2) the lead three minutes later, finishing Rodriguez's pass from a narrow angle. It was the 19-year-old's first professional goal.


 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.


 Kei Kamara scored on a header in the 66th minute to cut it to 3-2. Benny Feilhaber gave the Rapids (0-5-2) the lead in the 11th minute with a shot from the left side of the 6-yard box.

 D.C. United moved a point ahead of the Columbus Crew for first place in the Eastern Conference.


 Colorado lost its fourth in a row.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010

  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray

 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

   Marvel Studios’ woman problem
  
 
 
  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 The hero’s journey to this milestone is filled with many memorable moments, from his debut, to Robin’s and Batgirl’s and more.

 
  This cover of Detective Comics No. 1000, drawn by Nicola Scott and colored by Annette Kwok, will be sold at King's Comics in Sydney, Australia. Scott, who is Australian, described the cover as “a class photo, Batman through the decades.”

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .

   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

   Marvel Studios’ woman problem
  
 
 
  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 Eaton DC, 1201 K Street NW Washington DC, 202-289-7600;

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .

   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero.

National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .

   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .

   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 Eaton DC, 1201 K Street NW Washington DC, 202-289-7600;

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .

   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 Eaton DC, 1201 K Street NW Washington DC, 202-289-7600;

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .


 
  [Read The New York Times
 
 
  
   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 Eaton DC, 1201 K Street NW Washington DC, 202-289-7600;

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .


 
  [Read The New York Times
 
 
  
   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values

 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 Eaton DC, 1201 K Street NW Washington DC, 202-289-7600;

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .


 
  [Read The New York Times
 
 
  
   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

  history of the Brooklyn Bridge and about
 
 
  
   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .


 
  [Read The New York Times
 
 
  
   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

  history of the Brooklyn Bridge and about
 
 
  
   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.

 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Lucas Rodriguez had a goal and an assist and D.C. United scored three times within a nine-minute span to beat the Colorado Rapids 3-2 on Saturday night.


 Luciano Acosta tied it at 1 in the 35th minute with a left-footed rocket into the roof on the net.


 Chris Durkin gave United (4-1-2) the lead three minutes later, finishing Rodriguez's pass from a narrow angle. It was the 19-year-old's first professional goal.


 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.


 Kei Kamara scored on a header in the 66th minute to cut it to 3-2. Benny Feilhaber gave the Rapids (0-5-2) the lead in the 11th minute with a shot from the left side of the 6-yard box.

 D.C. United moved a point ahead of the Columbus Crew for first place in the Eastern Conference.


 Colorado lost its fourth in a row.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.


 By
 
 
  
   Jeremy W. Peters
  
 

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.

 WASHINGTON — Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills and Washington Wizards forward Devin Robinson were arrested after a fight outside a nightclub, Washington police said Saturday.


 Karimah Bilal, program manager for the Metropolitan Police Department's office of communications, confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that the Mills named in the police report is the Eagles player.


 Both the 6-foot, 191-pound Mills and the 6-foot-8, 200-pound Robinson were charged with disorderly affray, which generally refers to fighting in a public place.


 The two men were "involved in a verbal altercation which escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk adjacent to the Opera Night Club" in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to the police report.

 Robinson was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report said.


 He also lost his job with the Wizards.


 "We are aware of the incident this morning involving Devin and are disappointed in his actions. We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.


 The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.


 Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.


 Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.

 Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.

 WASHINGTON — Diego Rossi had his first career MLS hat trick to help LAFC snap D.C. United's 15-game regular-season unbeaten streak with a 4-0 win on Saturday.


 Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading seventh goal of the season in the 15th minute, ripping a left-footer from the top of the box to give LAFC (5-0-1) a 1-0 lead.


 Rossi, from near midfield, played a ball wide to Vela on the left side and then sprinted into the area where he slipped a left-footer inside the near post in the 27th. Rossi first-timed a bending side-netter about five minutes later to make it 3-0 at halftime and capped the scoring in the 76th minute.


 Vela and Rossi have more goals (13) this season than any other MLS team.


 LAFC has won three in a row and has outscored its opponents 19-5 this season.

 D.C. United (3-1-1) played a man down after Wayne Rooney, who came in among the MLS leaders this season in goals (four) and assists (three), was shown a straight red card in the 52nd, after video review, for a dangerous tackle on Rossi.


 It was United's worst loss since a 4-0 decision against the Portland Timbers on Oct. 15, 2017.

 Holy milestones, Batman!
 
 Detective Comics
 
 , where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on
 
 Wednesday
 
 , just days before the hero’s 80th birthday. “It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades,” Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.


 Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller’s vision of Batman helped pave the way for
 
  Tim Burton’s “Batman
 
 ,” starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.


 Since then, we’ve had many film Batmen —
 
 
 his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan
 
 ) — but his guiding principle has remained the same. “Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil,” Sanderson said.

 Comic book creators,
 
 historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman’s career. Here they are:


 March
 
 1939


 Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The
 
 Bat-Man
 
 , as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue’s six-page “
 
  The Case of the Chemical Syndicate
 
 .” (The later cover date — of May, in this instance — was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist
 
  Bob Kane
 
 and the writer
 
  Bill Finger
 
 , though it took many years for Finger to
 
  receive credit
 
 for his significant contributions to the
 
 canon.
 
 Another bat-fact: A copy of
 
 Detective
 
 No. 27
 
  sold at auction for $1.075 million
 
 in
 
 2010
 
 .


 
  [Read The New York Times
 
 
  
   obituary for Bob Kane
  
 
 
  , who died in 1998, and a short
 
 
  
   article about Bill Finger and the Bronx
  
 
 
  .]
 


 March
 
 1940


 The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. “Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to,” said
 
  Peter J. Tomasi
 
 , who writes the current Detective Comics series.


 It certainly hooked me.
 
 As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was
 
 Dick
 
 Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and
 
  transformation into Nightwing
 
 , a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive
 
 Batman
 
 cannot. Since Dick’s graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne’s son,
 
 Damian
 
 .

  history of the Brooklyn Bridge and about
 
 
  
   how Dick Grayson grew up
  
 
 
  .]
 


 December 1949


 
  Michael E. Uslan
 
 , a comic books historian and a producer of the
 
 “Batman” films
 
 , called this issue transformative. “The Batmobile of 1950,” he
 
 said
 
 , “redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher
 
 tech
 
 .” (There have since been
 
  many iterations of the Batmobile
 
 .) The cover mentions
 
  an “Indian lawman,”
 
 a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, “That name’s too tough to pronounce,” and calls him
 
 Pow Wow
 
 , based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to
 
 violence
 
 
 if needed.
 


 March 1964


 “This issue introduces the legendary ‘New Look’ Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story,” Uslan said. “Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!” The chief architects of the
 
 evolution
 
 were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up
 
  sagging sales
 
 in the hopes of avoiding
 
  cancellation
 
 .


 November 1966


 When producers of the
 
  Batman television series
 
 wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got
 
  Batgirl
 
 , whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham’s police commissioner. Batgirl’s career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC’s heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that
 
  returned her to the rooftops
 
 . Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and
 
 Dick Grayson
 
 
 as
 
 a romantic dynamic duo.


 
  [When the Adam West
 
 
  
   “Batman” series came to Blu-ray
  
 
 
  .]
 


 November 1973


 Batman has no dialogue in “
 
  Night of the Stalker
 
 ,” which is a little gimmicky but manages to
 
 work
 
 , if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story — written by
 
  Steve Englehart
 
 , plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by
 
  Dick Giordano
 
 — begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly “sorrow explodes within him” as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: “In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity … he is that boy again.”


 December 1975


 Another side of Batman
 
 emerges
 
 in “There Is No Hope in Crime Alley,” by
 
  Denny O’Neil
 
 and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out
 
  Leslie Thompkins
 
 , a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler,
 
 Alfred
 
 , finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.


 December 1980


 
  Paul Levitz
 
 , whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by
 
  Walter Gibson
 
 , the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of
 
 Batman, Detective and World’s Finest
 
 that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.


 June 2009


 Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was
 
  rebooted in 2006
 
 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping
 
  true to the mission of the Batman characters
 
 , who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.


 March 2019


 This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, “Batman’s Longest Case,” by
 
  Scott Snyder
 
 and
 
  Greg Capullo
 
 , recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including
 
  Slam Bradley
 
 (
 
 12 years
 
 ),
 
  Martian Manhunter
 
 (nine years) and
 
  Elongated Man
 
 (five years). “The richness, variety and popularity of these
 
 backups
 
 contributed to Detective’s success and longevity,” said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad
 
 I run with
 
 , who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name
 
  Captain Marvel
 
 , as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection.


 In 1939,
 
  Billy Batson
 
 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get
 
  his own film
 
 , starring Zachary Levi, next month.

  ]
 

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 
  Mar-Vell
 
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.


 In 1967,
 
  Carol Danvers
 
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).

 Introduced in 1982,
 
  Monica Rambeau
 
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.


 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed
 
  Nor-Varr
 
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”


 When her series began in 2014,
 
  Kamala Khan
 
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”
 
  she said.
 

 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau was introduced into the Marvel comics universe. It was 1982, not 1987.

 It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing
 
  “The Umbrella Academy”
 
 on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing
 
  “Doom Patrol,”
 
 while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics.


 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.”


 So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values
 
  (“Black Lightning” on CW)
 
 or go all in on replicating the comic book experience
 
  (“Legion” on FX)
 
 . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced
 
  and
 
 they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family.


 Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which
 
  Way has generously cited
 
 as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.

 And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform.


 The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.)

 It takes stabs at hallucinatory,
 
  Gregory Crewdson-like
 
 visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious.


 
  [
 
 
  
   Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.
  
 
 
  ]
 


 Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War.

 It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s
 
  “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn,”
 
 ), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can.


 The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama.


 The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton).


 “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.”


 Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.

 COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Lucas Rodriguez had a goal and an assist and D.C. United scored three times within a nine-minute span to beat the Colorado Rapids 3-2 on Saturday night.


 Luciano Acosta tied it at 1 in the 35th minute with a left-footed rocket into the roof on the net.


 Chris Durkin gave United (4-1-2) the lead three minutes later, finishing Rodriguez's pass from a narrow angle. It was the 19-year-old's first professional goal.


 Rodriguez slipped through three defenders before flicking it past Tim Howard to make it 3-1 in the 43rd minute.


 Kei Kamara scored on a header in the 66th minute to cut it to 3-2. Benny Feilhaber gave the Rapids (0-5-2) the lead in the 11th minute with a shot from the left side of the 6-yard box.

 D.C. United moved a point ahead of the Columbus Crew for first place in the Eastern Conference.


 Colorado lost its fourth in a row.

 Check In


 On K Street, better known as home to the capital’s lobbyists, you can now wake up ‘woke” and in style.

 From $139.


 Given that people of opposing political persuasions tend to live, eat, shop, work and worship in self-selected bubbles, it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided that Republicans and Democrats needed their own hotels too. Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation’s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but “a community with a shared ethos of caring for today’s world.” Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as “the optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders”), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant — all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.


 K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It’s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city’s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International).

 The regular rooms — Eaton calls them cabins or studies — are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-à-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the “Inclusivity Menu” on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)

 Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can’t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here — just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels.

 The Eaton can feel a bit like a mission statement that just happens to let you sleep there. But
 
 
 other aspects of the property more appropriately serve its community-focused purpose. The shared work space, where people can rent desks for a monthly fee like at WeWork or Cove, is handsomely furnished — like a graduate student study carrel brought to you by Room &amp; Board. There is a small studio in the lobby for recording or broadcasting audio. The wellness center, which was in its soft opening when we visited in late November, offered yoga classes, a meditation room, sound baths and saunas that use infrared technology to heat your body instead of hot coals.


 In case you were wondering whether there are any profit margins for a business that sounds like it would shun high-priced indulgences, look no further than the restaurant American Son, where our starter dish of three smallish-sized scallops was $24.
 
  
  
 
 Most of the items on the menu were vegetable based, like the gem-lettuce Caesar served lightly charred ($12) and a rich tofu gnocchi with sunchokes, black truffle and chive ($28). For carnivores there was a shareable rib-eye for $125 (yes, $125) and duck for $100. There are two bars on the property. One is a speakeasy called Allegory tucked away off the lobby behind two unmarked black doors with an extensive menu of craft cocktails. The other is a large rooftop club, Wild Days. Room service breakfast, ordered the night before from a cardboard door hanger, arrived almost exactly on time and with generous portions of scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and a potato and onion
 
 cake
 
 . Healthier options included an acai smoothie bowl with berries and shaved coconut.


 The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.
