  “Captain Marvel”
 </a>
 opens next Friday, it will be a moment of great satisfaction mixed with lingering frustration.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The film, which stars
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.instyle.com/celebrity/brie-larson-march-cover" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Brie Larson
 </a>
 as that spacefaring comic-book superhero, is the 21st entry in the interconnected Marvel movie franchise since it began in 2008 but only the first to focus principally on a woman.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 By now, audiences have grown accustomed to superhero movies that put women in the spotlight. In 2017,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/31/movies/wonder-woman-review-gal-gadot.html?module=inline" title="">
  “Wonder Woman,”
 </a>
 based on DC Comics’ Amazonian warrior, was a worldwide hit for Warner Bros.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Marvel has built its own fortunes on a decades-old supply of costumed adventurers that doesn’t lack for women. And the studio has been criticized for its slowness to create movies emphasizing its female characters.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So what took Marvel as long as it did to reach this point? And will “Captain Marvel” be the movie that makes good on this long unfulfilled potential?

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The answer to the first question, at least, lies in a tangle of social, cultural and economic factors. They parallel similar issues that Marvel has faced in making strides toward female representation in its comic books over the past 60 years — efforts that gradually helped bring Captain Marvel to prominence in the publisher’s pantheon and make the movie more likely.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The people behind “Captain Marvel” — the movie as well as the comic books that inspired it — acknowledge the problematic history that led to these more welcome developments.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 They also see opportunities for women to have an equal place on the page and on the screen, and for the Captain Marvel character to grow as an icon of female representation and empowerment.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “What Captain Marvel needed to be when she debuted in the 1960s is very different than what she needs to be in 2019, when she’s anchoring a major film,” said Kelly Thompson, the current author of the Captain Marvel comic book series. “The film has her poised to be more important to more people than ever, and comics gets to be the proving ground for the character.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Marvel, the Disney-owned home of the Avengers superteam, has become an important bellwether of diversity in Hollywood. The studio has broken ground with films like
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/06/movies/black-panther-review-movie.html?module=inline" title="">
  “Black Panther,”
 </a>
 its 2018 blockbuster with a black director, screenwriters and leading actors.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In recent years Marvel has also gained a reputation for giving opportunities to filmmakers who don’t have a background in tentpole action movies. That category includes the “Captain Marvel” directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, who are better known for low-budget offerings like “Mississippi Grind” and “It’s Kind of a Funny Story.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Recalling an early meeting with Marvel, Boden said they told the studio, “All we have is the character stuff. And they said, ‘We know how to explode things — we need directors who can tell a story.’”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 (“Captain Marvel,” written by Boden, Fleck and Geneva Robertson-Dworet, is also the first Marvel movie to have a female director and only the second, after 2014’s “Guardians of the Galaxy,” to credit women as screenwriters.)
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Larson,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_lq5wORkYA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  an Academy Award winner for the 2015 drama “Room,”
 </a>
 said she was initially wary when she was approached for “Captain Marvel” and unsure if she wanted to take on such a high-profile role.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But the actress, who has called for greater participation by women and people of color in the film industry and in the media covering it, said the global rollout of “Captain Marvel” could help bring her advocacy to a wider audience.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 She said she felt invested in the moral lessons of her smaller films like
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhS6tvSb0UQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Short Term 12.”
 </a>
 But when it came to “Captain Marvel,” Larson said she asked herself, “Could I still do the same thing of caring about the content and making sure it has a message while also playing all over the world? Being able to shape the conversation is what female leadership looks like.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In Captain Marvel’s favor, Larson said that while other Marvel heroes are weak and lowly at the start of their origin stories, “she was a badass before she got her powers.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 A former Air Force test pilot named Carol Danvers, she gains superhuman abilities from an alien race, and Boden described the movie as a mystery of sorts in which Danvers must investigate her own past.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “As she gets to know herself and embrace what makes her
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  her
 </em>
 , she really achieves her true power,” Boden said. “Part of that means rejecting the voices of people who tell her she’s not strong enough and doesn’t belong. I feel like a lot of people will be able to relate to that, particularly women.”
</p>

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  THE CHARACTER OF CAROL DANVERS
 </strong>
 has been on a journey of her own
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.vox.com/2014/11/5/7138099/captain-marvel-background-history-movie" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  since Marvel introduced her in the comics in 1968
 </a>
 . At the time, she was not much more than a Lois Lane-type love interest for a male hero (an extraterrestrial soldier who was the publisher’s original Captain Marvel).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Marvel, where its audacious editor
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/obituaries/stan-lee-dead.html?module=inline" title="">
  Stan Lee
 </a>
 led a roster of talented writers and illustrators, was celebrated in that era for its inclusivity. But its earliest efforts at female representation can now seem like tokenism.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “You can’t help but think that if Stan Lee wasn’t a conscious sexist, he certainly was so traditional,” said Heidi MacDonald, editor of
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.comicsbeat.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  The Beat
 </a>
 , a comics culture website. “He gave his female characters the weakest powers — ‘Oh, I can get very small.’ ‘I can turn invisible.’ ‘I can move a teacup with my mind.’”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In the 1970s and ’80s, Marvel put out its first solo female superhero comics and introduced
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.marvel.com/characters/spider-woman-jessica-drew" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Spider-Woman
 </a>
 and
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.marvel.com/characters/she-hulk-jennifer-walters" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  She-Hulk
 </a>
 , gender-swapped versions of its best-known characters who were intended, in part, to protect the publisher’s copyrights.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In a nod to the growing feminist movement, Marvel transformed Danvers into
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://flashbak.com/feminism-fail-ms-marvel-comics-in-the-1970s-31303/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Ms. Marvel
 </a>
 , giving her a solo series in which she battled intergalactic villains and wore a navel-baring costume.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The character would go in and out of vogue over the years, a period when many women would drift away from comics. The publications became harder to find at bookstores and newsstands, and female readers were alienated by
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.geekinsider.com/on-the-rape-of-ms-marvel/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  sexist story lines
 </a>
 and artwork that reduced women to sidekicks and stereotypes.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “In the ’80s and ’90s, we made comics that were actively insulting to women,” the writer Kelly Sue DeConnick said. “Women left in droves. Because why are you going to read stuff that’s actively insulting to you, that you have to get at a specialty store where you’re not always welcome?”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 DeConnick sought to counteract this when she reintroduced Carol Danvers
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.marvel.com/comics/series/16280/captain_marvel_2012_-_2013" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  in a 2012 series
 </a>
 in which the character finally assumed the title of Captain Marvel and donned a jumpsuit more appropriate to her military background.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In the preceding years, DeConnick said, “she had gone from wearing a gymnast’s leotard with thigh boots to a thong. It was the most disingenuous thing in the world.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 DeConnick, whose father served in the Air Force for 20 years, said she wanted to inscribe Danvers in the tradition of the pilot aces she’d long admired.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “I grew up on Air Force bases and have a real soft spot for the history of aviation,” DeConnick said. Citing pilots like
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pappy-Boyington" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Pappy Boyington
 </a>
 and Chuck Yeager, she added, “You can have swagger and you can still be military.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 At the same time, female readers were returning to comics, encouraged by new publication formats and more inclusive plots and characters.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The revitalized Carol Danvers had become a central player in Marvel’s comics universe, and the publisher successfully introduced a diverse array of characters like
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/t-magazine/miles-morales-spiderman.html?module=inline" title="">
  a young new Spider-Man, Miles Morales
 </a>
 , who is of black and Puerto Rican descent, and
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/06/books/marvel-comics-introducing-a-muslim-girl-superhero.html?module=inline" title="">
  a new Ms. Marvel, Kamala Khan
 </a>
 , who is a Muslim teenager.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Most crucially, said Thompson, the current Captain Marvel author, “Marvel put their support behind these characters. You have to put good talent on their books, but you have to support and advertise for them and push them as premier characters. Let’s not ignore that part of the equation.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  MARVEL’S MOVIES, HOWEVER, DID NOT KEEP PACE.
 </strong>
 The studio’s earliest releases were focused on
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1g-B8BJzwc&amp;t=5s" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  establishing core male heroes like Iron Man, Captain America and Thor
 </a>
 ; though its cinematic universe had included female characters like Black Widow (played by Scarlett Johansson) and the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) as members of larger teams, there were no solo films in development for them.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Even Marvel seemed prey to a longstanding Hollywood fallacy that while women will watch movies about men, men will not watch movies about women. “Because women are low-status in our culture,” DeConnick said, “you will aspire up, you will not cross-identify down.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 That perception of the studio appeared to be reinforced by
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://time.com/3847432/marvel-ceo-leaked-email/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  the leak of a 2014 email from Isaac Perlmutter
 </a>
 , the chairman of Marvel Entertainment, in which he disparaged female superhero films like
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxXbvzOdj-Q" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Supergirl”
 </a>
 (1984),
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6pJbjbRnAA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Catwoman”
 </a>
 (2004) and
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGnADb5e0mc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “Elektra”
 </a>
 (2005) for their poor box-office performances.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Similarly, when the Marvel studio
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/marvel-shake-up-film-chief-819205" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  was reorganized in 2015
 </a>
 , allowing its president, Kevin Feige, to report directly to Disney and sidestep Perlmutter, industry observers assumed that this gave Feige the freedom to pursue more diverse movies like “Black Panther” and “Captain Marvel.” (Marvel and Disney declined to comment on this.)
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Boden and Fleck, the “Captain Marvel” directors, said it was difficult to escape the grip of Hollywood tradition, in which most genre movies still focus on male leads.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Even looking at our own films, why did it take us five films to have one about a female protagonist?” Fleck said. “Hopefully we get to the point where these stories are being told all the time.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Asked what conclusions he and Boden had reached by reflecting on their own body of work, Fleck replied, “We haven’t arrived at the insights yet. I think they’re coming though.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 For all of the unresolved questions that “Captain Marvel” raises, MacDonald, the Beat editor, said that Marvel still deserved credit for getting the movie produced and generating enthusiasm for the character.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “There’s definitely a lot of history that they had to buck to get ‘Captain Marvel’ made,” she said. “They built a real basis for this character and a passion for what she stood for” as well as a fan base that is “very powerful.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 She added, “Is it millions and millions of people? No, it isn’t. But it doesn’t need to be. It needs to be that core, that spark.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 There is no expectation that “Captain Marvel” will match the monumental box-office results of last year’s “Black Panther,” which grossed $1.3 billion worldwide, or “Avengers: Infinity War,” which took in $2 billion globally and
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFomwoVngOI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  ended on a catastrophic cliffhanger
 </a>
 that fans have waited almost a year to see resolved. By comparison, Marvel’s “Ant-Man and the Wasp,” a summer 2018 release that starred Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly, had global grosses of $622 million.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/captain-marvel-tracking-marvelous-100m-debut-1186612" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Recent tracking reports estimate
 </a>
 that “Captain Marvel” will bring in more than $100 million in its opening weekend, and MacDonald said the movie will probably appeal to multiple constituencies: not only fans of the character and women who want to watch female-led films, but also Marvel obsessives who want to see how it ties into Marvel’s next battle royale, “Avengers: Endgame,” which opens April 26.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Kevin Feige is very smart,” MacDonald said. “He’s releasing the movie that would be the hardest sell in a position where it’s going to lead into the greatest final act in movie history.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s unclear whether “Captain Marvel” will be the start of a trend or an outlier for Marvel. Hollywood trade publications have reported that the studio is preparing other female-led projects, including a Black Widow movie, starring Johansson and directed by Cate Shortland (“Lore”), and a film adaptation of the Eternals, directed by Chloé Zhao (“The Rider”). But Disney said it could not confirm Marvel’s development slate.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Whether “Captain Marvel” can be a harbinger for other movies like it, Larson said, “is a larger question, a systemic thing.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “That change is scary,” she said, “and it takes time for it to come. It’s slow but it’s happening.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The only way such progress can happen, Larson said, is if she and her peers use the influence afforded by movies like “Captain Marvel” to strive for further changes and to make them permanent.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Part of why I’m pushing really hard now is because I do have a little bit of power, and I’m going to use it,” she said. “You don’t know when it’s going to shift again or who’s going to have the power next. But I’ll push it as far as I can. Because it’s the right thing to do.”
</p><p class="css-1e7dx92 evys1bk0">
 An earlier version of this article misstated the kind of boots Captain Marvel wore before the character was reintroduced in 2012. In the preceding years, she wore thigh boots, not side boots. The earlier version also misstated which branch of the military Pappy Boyington served in. It was the Marines, not the Air Force.

 One thing we learn in “Captain Marvel” is that it’s pronounced MarVELL, like the English poet — or at least it used to be, on distant planets and right here on Earth, a windy rock also known as C-53. That was back in 1995, when most of this movie takes place and when the world as we know it had not yet been colonized by the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Yes, of course, Marvel Comics had been around for decades, but when the heroine crashes through the roof of the Blockbuster Video store, landing in between the “Family” and “Drama” sections, there are no Avengers or Iron-Man titles on the shelves.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Instead, she picks up a VHS box of
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/21/movies/film-right-stuff-on-astronauts.html?module=inline" title="">
  “The Right Stuff,”
 </a>
 which earns a mild chuckle, since while we know that she’s a space alien named Vers (rhymes with “cheers”), we also have reason to suspect that this young woman is connected with the United States Air Force, and maybe the space program, too, like the guys in that film. Also known as Carol Danvers, and played by Brie Larson, she has some of their bravado, and also — since she’s on the way to intergalactic superheroism — a righteous sense of mission and a burgeoning identity crisis.

 The last and least surprising thing we learn about her is that “Captain Marvel will return in ‘Avengers: Endgame,’” a scrappy little picture that will be released in seven weeks, if you can stand to wait that long. Directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck from a script they wrote with Geneva Robertson-Dworet, “Captain Marvel” is an origin story, which is to say a résumé check for the newest member of popular culture’s biggest, most heavily capitalized corporate team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 As such, it’s pretty good fun, and could almost be described without sarcasm as a scrappy little picture, like most of Boden and Fleck’s other work. (

</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And of course Samuel L. Jackson, who plays a young, two-eyed S.H.I.E.L.D. agent named Nicholas Fury. How Fury lost one of those eyes is the big spoiler to avoid here, and the character’s extended presence, after so many agitated cameos over the years, is a big part of the movie’s appeal. To watch the digitally rejuvenated Jackson riding around mid-90s Los Angeles, sort of like he did in “Pulp Fiction,” is to indulge in a bit of Gen-X nostalgia, a mood augmented by period-appropriate musical cues from Salt-N-Pepa, TLC and Nirvana.

 There are pay phones and pagers, too, and boxy government cars and all kinds of stuff that kids these days just don’t appreciate. Even the science-fiction elements have a mildly retro, “Star Trek: The Next Generation” feel. And the overall vibe, for all the fireballs and fisticuffs, is decidedly friendly. In addition to the Vers/Fury buddy-movie pairing, there is a best friend for Carol (a fellow pilot named Maria Rambeau, played by Lashana Lynch) and a succession of frenemies. Best of all, there is an orange cat.

 The plot of “Captain Marvel,” for some reason, is another secret I’m supposed to keep. Which is fine. In spite of what some unhinged fans on social media might say, I was not paid by Disney to explain anything. Boden and Fleck were, and they do a perfectly adequate job. There’s a big war going on between the Kree — Vers’s people, at least as far as she knows — and the Skrull, green-skinned, pointy-eared beings who have the unnerving skill of turning into doppelgängers of anyone they see. Annette Bening is involved. We first see her as a manifestation of Supreme Intelligence, which seems accurate enough. I’ll say no more.

 The twists in the story reveal a slyly anti-imperialist politics, which is both in keeping with the pluralist ethic of the Avengers cycle and just a bit subversive of the Disney-Marvel agenda of universal domination. The most sympathetic group of characters wants nothing more than to go somewhere else, to escape from the annihilating attention of their would-be conquerors. They might represent various oppressed and dispossessed earthly populations. They might also stand in for that portion of the movie audience that feels the cinematic universe shrinking around them.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Not that anyone can stop the Marvel Cinematic Universe from expanding. By now the contradictions of this gigantic enterprise are obvious enough. It’s inclusive and monopolistic, predatory and empowering. Every episode is unique — every hero is a complex individual with a singular back story — within an overall structure of sameness.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Filmmakers like Boden and Fleck, Ryan Coogler and Taika Waititi can put their own spin on a given story or hero, but at some point bolts or waves of orange or blue light will come shooting out of someone’s hands and someone else will be thrown backward and bounce off a wall. The protagonist’s costume will become a character in its own right. That protagonist — a tough and charming woman, in this case, determined to fight gender clichés at least to a draw — will be ready for a career of franchise clock-punching, along with the rest of us. You will stay through the very last credits in the hope of collecting every last Easter egg, and you’ll shuffle out of the theater feeling both satisfied and empty.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

  Nor-Varr
 </a>
 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

  she said.

 As “Captain Marvel” swooped into its second weekend in theaters on Friday, the question wasn’t really whether it would top domestic ticket sales, but by how much.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Disney-Marvel can breathe easy. Their latest superhero origin story, the
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/movies/captain-marvel.html?module=inline" title="">
  first film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe dedicated to a female superhero
 </a>
 , sold an estimated $69.3 million in tickets nationwide this weekend, bringing its North American total to around $266.2 million.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 That’s a higher figure than the lifetime domestic gross of “Captain America: The Winter Soldier” ($259.8 million), and already makes “Captain Marvel” the 13th-best-selling film in the current 21-movie Marvel series — with room to grow.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Captain Marvel” has done well internationally, too, with $120 million in overseas sales this weekend, according to the studio, for a global total of $760 million. While the figures aren’t earth-shattering, they indicate a solid success for Disney-Marvel.

 That success came despite attempts by trolls to derail “Captain Marvel.” Ahead of its release, the film was the target of efforts at online sabotage by users apparently lashing out against its star, Brie Larson, who has been outspoken in her support of more diverse representation in Hollywood movies. The campaign
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/movies/captain-marvel-brie-larson-rotten-tomatoes.html?module=inline" title="">
  prompted the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes to make major changes to its longstanding rules,
 </a>
 including the elimination of audience reviews for movies that have not yet been released.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Free from any targeted online attack was Paramount’s “Wonder Park,” an animated family movie about a young girl who
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/movies/wonder-park-amusement-parks.html?module=inline" title="">

 </a>
 and sees them colorfully brought to life. That movie sold $16 million in tickets domestically this weekend, according to Comscore, which compiles box-office data. While a far cry from “Captain Marvel,” the figure was more than enough to land “Wonder Park” in second place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The only other newcomer in the top five was Lionsgate and CBS Films’s “Five Feet Apart,” in third. The movie, about a couple whose shared genetic disorder forces them to maintain physical distance from each other despite their growing romance, sold $13.2 million in tickets.
</p><p class="css-1e7dx92 evys1bk0">
 An earlier version of this article omitted the name of a distributor of “Five Feet Apart.” The movie is distributed by Lionsgate and CBS Films, not just Lionsgate.

 But “Captain Marvel” is not the only recent female-led film in the comic or sci-fi realm to be swarmed by trolls. As my colleague Cara Buckley
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/movies/captain-marvel-brie-larson-rotten-tomatoes.html?module=inline" title="">

 : “The all-female remake of ‘Ghostbusters,’ ‘Black Panther’ and ‘Star Wars: The Last Jedi,’ which had a diverse cast, all found themselves in the cross hairs of armchair critics, some aligned with alt-right groups.”
</p>

 Last year, a Facebook group called “Down with Disney’s Treatment of Franchises and Its Fanboys” posted an event called “Give Black Panther a Rotten Audience Score on Rotten Tomatoes.” The group had also

  claimed responsibility

 for sinking scores for “Star Wars: The Last Jedi.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Those who appeared to have targeted “Captain Marvel” were most likely incited by comments made by Brie Larson, the titular star. Last year, Larson vowed to seek out more underrepresented journalists after noticing she was being interviewed by mostly white men. She had a similar critique about film critics: “I do not need a 40-year-old white dude to tell me what didn’t work for him about ‘A Wrinkle in Time.’ It wasn’t made for him.”

 Today, we think of Marvel as the monolithic studio that each year reliably releases two or three blockbusters based on its costume-clad comic-book superheroes. It has built movies like

  “Iron Man”
 </a>
 in 2008.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But Marvel’s prosperous future was hardly a certainty a decade or so ago. In the mid-2000s it was a smaller, inexperienced company that controlled the film rights for only a few of its lesser-known characters — other studios had already brought “X-Men,” “Spider-Man” and “Fantastic Four” to theaters — at a time when no one in Hollywood was yet contemplating the idea of an interconnected universe of superhero movies.
</p>

 That changed with the help of people like Kevin Feige, who had been an associate producer on “X-Men” before Marvel hired him in 2000; and

</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In interviews, Feige, now the president of Marvel Studios, and Downey — a star of three “Iron Man”s, four “Avengers” and a “Spider-Man” — spoke about the origins of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the choices they made, and what it’s all meant as “Endgame” approaches. Here are edited excerpts from those conversations.

 In 2006, when we were making our first appearance as our own studio at Comic-Con, the articles written around that were basically: “Marvel’s going to try to make movies themselves now. Too bad they’ve got to scrape the bottom of the barrel.” And I remember feeling, wow, I don’t think it’s the bottom of the barrel.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Initially, there were 10 characters on an official list. And Iron Man was not one of them. Iron Man became one of them when the rights reverted back to Marvel from [New Line Cinema], it instantly went to the top of the list. We were very excited that we could do something different with that film. We had that and

 in the same year. And internally, at Marvel corporate, “Hulk” — by far, the better-known property — seemed like the slam-dunk and “Iron Man” seemed like the risk.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  Marvel started hiring cast and crew for “Iron Man” in 2006 — first, the director Jon Favreau and then its star, Robert Downey Jr., both of whom were coming off recent flops.

 Jon and I had this connection. He’d had a movie that I very much enjoyed, and I’d had one that he very much enjoyed, bomb at the same time. His was

 And “Zathura” put him in a position to be considered viable and capable of doing an effects-driven movie. And “Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,” if not the best movie I’ve ever done, it’s the one I made the fewest mistakes in as an actor.

 I have a distinct memory of being in this bullpen area of our production office, kicking around ideas with Jon, and Robert’s name came up. We both stopped and looked at each other, like: “Oh, that would be awesome. But nah, you can’t do that. Anyway, who else?” And we kept coming back to that.

 I took a meeting at Marvel. And then I was very pushy, to be honest, which is not really in my nature. But I just had a sneaking suspicion that I had nothing to lose. I decided to take it more seriously than I’d ever taken anything. I felt confident, and then I was told that the meeting went well but I wouldn’t put too much on it, it’s probably not going to go your way. I refused to let go of it.

 I remember saying to a room full of marketing executives: “If we do our job right, the name Tony Stark will be as famous as the name Iron Man. Because unlike a lot of hero movies, this character is as interesting and as engaging outside of his costume, as he is inside of his costume.” [Downey had] not done something like this before, which meant, I felt, a screen test would help convince anybody that needed to be convinced. He, to his credit, was absolutely willing to audition for it.

 We were at an assembly hangar where they made the Spruce Goose. We haven’t started shooting yet and we decide to take out a bunch of pellet pistols and put on protective eyewear, and me and Favreau and a couple other folks literally had a psychotic shootout. And I just thought that was the dumbest, unnecessary, insurance-risk thing I’ve ever done — and that’s really saying something. It was our comic-book D-Day. We knew it was upon us and we were about to start something that could wind up being culturally significant.

 We were at Giorgio Baldi, which is a famous Italian joint. We had a little private room there on Friday night as the numbers came in from Paramount.

 That Monday after the opening weekend, we announced dates for “Iron Man 2,” “Thor,” “Captain America” and “Avengers.” I remember being very excited that the movie worked well enough that we could do this. We’re gonna do the plan! This is going to be a big deal. And the press did not treat it like a big deal. It was a footnote to an article about the success of the “Iron Man” opening weekend.

 The real daunting thing was, oh, that’s right, we have to go do this again. We get a year break, and I stayed very busy that year, and then we had to do it again. The word “franchise” is a verb, if you ask me. You are iterating something that needs to be recreated in some way and expanded upon every time.

 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">

 I started to use phrases like “Phase 1 of the MCU,” because I didn’t want to merely think of an “Iron Man” trilogy or a “Thor” trilogy. Which is really the way most people had been conditioned to think about franchises. It all came from the comics — individual characters would occasionally come together for a mega-event limited series, in which everything would change, and then they would go back into their own comics, with the new powers or the new costumes or the psychological changes from that big adventure. That’s what we could do with one phase, and then an “Avengers” movie, a second phase, another “Avengers” movie, and then a third one to close it out.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">

 The first “Avengers” tour was just mind-bogglingly cool and strange, considering that the film was about to be released but was already being treated like it was a phenomenon. The sheer fact that the world was going, oh, you actually got a lot of actors and actresses to get along for long enough.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">

  As this latest phase of Marvel movies nears its conclusion, Feige and Downey tried to summarize the experience.

 This has been my life for the better part of a decade. I’ve gotten married in that decade. I’ve had two kids in that decade. And I’ve produced 23 movies in that decade. I almost don’t want to stop and think about it, for fear of getting blubbery and embarrassing myself.

 If someone had walked into Giorgio Baldi that night and said, hey guys, I’m 10 Years From The Future Guy, let me tell what you started here. You would just go, “No, what if this goes wrong?” You’d be tripping on the what-if’s. It’s a faith-based activity.

 LOS ANGELES — The directors of "Avengers: Endgame" pleaded with fans on Tuesday not to spoil the movie by giving away storylines after reports that some scenes had leaked online.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In an open letter posted on Twitter under the hashtag #DontSpoilTheEndgame, Joe and Anthony Russo said they and the vast cast of the upcoming Marvel superhero movie "have worked tirelessly for the last three years with the sole intention of delivering a surprising and emotionally powerful conclusion" to the saga.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "When you see Endgame in coming weeks, please don't spoil it for others, the same way you wouldn't want it spoiled for you," they added.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Walt Disney Co's "Avengers: Endgame" marks the conclusion of a story told across 22 Marvel films. The plot has been shrouded in secrecy, with no advance screenings for the entertainment press. Sales of advance tickets earlier this month surpassed those of 2015 movie "Star Wars: The Force Awakens."
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The film, which brings together multiple comic book characters, starts its rollout on April 24 in Australia and China before arriving in the United States on April 25.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Some fans said on Tuesday they had seen brief, grainy scenes on Reddit, YouTube and other platforms, but the footage was swiftly removed. Reuters has not seen the leaked scenes and Disney declined to comment.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The #DontSpoilTheEnding hashtag was one of the top Twitter trends on Tuesday. Some fans who said they had viewed the leaks said they only increased their anticipation for the movie.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "I was upset for about 0.2 seconds then realized how cool it was and it made me so hyped," a person with the user name thestaggie posted on Reddit.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Chris Smith, a contributor to the BGR.com entertainment and tech news site, wrote that he had seen a leak but that it "doesn't really give away the ending" of the movie, although it contained scenes that had not been shown in any of the trailers or official clips released so far.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "I don’t consider that the leak has actually ruined the movie for me. It just makes me want to watch it even more than I already did," wrote Smith.

  The Associated Press
 </span>
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LOS ANGELES — About five years ago, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige found himself on a retreat in Palm Springs plotting the future for the wild, experimental "cinematic universe" that he helped start in 2008 . He wanted to do something that they hadn't done. He wanted an ending.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And after a quick pitch to Robert Downey Jr., he, directors Anthony and Joe Russo and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, started plotting a way to bring this saga to a close, brainstorming whenever they had a moment — even in between takes of "Captain America: Civil War."
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Anyone who saw "Avengers: Infinity War" knows they weren't kidding around either. Thanos literally dissolved half of humanity, including Spider-Man and Black Panther in an event known as "the snap" that's inspired tears, memes and more fan theories than the internet can hold. Talk about a cliffhanger.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Endings are a rarity in the franchise movie-making business; especially when one's popularity has only multiplied as the movies of Marvel have. But Marvel Studios, which has never shied away from a little rule-breaking, is taking a sledgehammer to that old "don't leave money on the table" maxim, and audiences will finally be able to see how they do it when "Avengers: Endgame" opens nationwide on April 25.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "(Ending) is not a scary word," Feige said. "It's a necessary word."
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 What exactly that means for the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is something of a state secret. Feige said that this will be "definitive," though.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "People can debate and discuss what that means before they see the movie," Feige said. "But for us that means bringing to a conclusion the first three phases, the first 22 films in the MCU, so that everything thereafter is a new start."
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So "new" in fact that Feige won't even discuss what's to come beyond the July release of "Spider-Man: Far From Home." He won't confirm reportedly in-the-works projects like the "Black Widow" stand-alone, "The Eternals" or "Shang-Chi," or talk about plans for the 20th Century Fox properties like "Deadpool" and "X-Men" that are now under his purview.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 They have the next five years mapped out; they're just not letting audiences peek behind the curtain until after "Endgame." It's that big.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "How we leave 'Endgame' will help define where we're going for many people," Feige said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But how does one talk about a movie that no press has seen and no actors or creators are allowed to discuss in detail? Well, carefully and cryptically.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 We know some things. That the heroes left like Iron Man (Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and War Machine(Don Cheadle) are dealing with the devastating loss post-snap while trying to figure out what to do with Thanos. A helpful "Avenge the Fallen" campaign served as a reminder of who survived and who didn't (some of the dusted were even a surprise, like "Black Panther's" Shuri). We also know they have a new weapon in Brie Larson's Captain Marvel, who Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury managed to page before dissolving into dust.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Will characters die, though? Probably. Will the ones lost in "the snap," remain gone? Unclear (although some who have upcoming movies, like, say Spider-Man, won't). But the cast and filmmakers aren't giving anything up, or even commenting on the fact that this might be the last of Evans as Captain America, which the actor himself tweeted about months ago.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "I still don't know what happens in this movie," said Larson, who actually even filmed her scenes in "Endgame" before "Captain Marvel," which came out earlier this year.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Filming proved an emotional experience for many of the actors, a lot of whom have now been working together for almost a decade or more.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "I was pretty teary-eyed," Evans said. "This is the culmination of a really long endeavor. It kind of wraps up the journey for a lot of these characters."
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It led to a lot of reflection, about where they started and how they've grown. Johansson noted that she'd been developing her character for 10 years now, and is excited that Black Widow has evolved from a "sexy secretary" type to a more fully realized woman.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "The whole shoot felt pretty nostalgic," Hemsworth added. "We were constantly talking about when it all started to how we pulled this off and what we were a part of."
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But he also admits he was "kind of happy to get off the set." An eight month shoot can wear even on Thor.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And indeed the shoot was grueling. The directors, who did "Winter Soldier," ''Civil War" and "Infinity War" said it was the hardest of their life.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "This went far beyond anything we'd ever done before," said Anthony Russo. "There's a reason why movies aren't made this way normally."
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But that this was unconventional was also the draw.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "I think the only reason we stuck around, is because they were committed to an ending and we're deconstructionists," said Joe Russo. "We like to take things apart and see the ramifications of what happens. 'Winter Soldier' the good guys became the bad guys, 'Civil War,' we divorced the heroes, 'Infinity War,' we killed half of them. We like to smash it and look at how you can put the pieces back together."
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And no one, not even Feige, regrets putting the MCU on this one-way path. That's not to say he never second guesses himself, however.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Two weeks before "Infinity War" came out he had a moment of panic about the snap.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "That ending was one of the reasons why we wanted to make the movie. That's how we sold it to Disney. We were confident in it," Feige said. "But then a week or two weeks before the film came out, I went, 'Oh no. We're killing all these people. What if the audience totally rejects it?'"
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Speaking just a few weeks before "Endgame" is unleashed on the world, Feige has found himself in a familiar spot.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Feige said: "It's not until the movie is completely finished, which 'Endgame' is now completely finished, when you can't touch it any more that you go, 'Wait a minute: Should we have touched it more?'"

 LOS ANGELES — Marvel's Avengers are back to save the world, and the box office.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "Avengers: Endgame" arrives in theaters on April 26 with the conclusion of the fight between the galaxy's greatest heroes and Thanos, who wiped out half of all life at the end of last year's "Avengers: Infinity War." It's one of the year's biggest releases, and one that many theater owners are hoping will draw huge audiences after a sluggish start to the year at the box office.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It is the 22nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a collection of movies that kicked off with 2008's "Iron Man." Since then, Marvel films have earned $18.6 billion at the box office, with the four "Avengers" films accounting for nearly $5 billion of that haul. Seven of the films, including this year's "Captain Marvel" and last year's sensation "Black Panther," have earned more than a billion dollars worldwide.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The following is a look at how Marvel has built its cinematic juggernaut, with the film's title, release date, domestic gross and total worldwide box office, as compiled by Comscore:

 Super Bowl LIII was a low-scoring game, and the trailers that debuted during the telecast kept their running times down as well. The ad for the Dwayne Johnson-Jason Statham “Fast &amp; Furious” spinoff,

  “Captain Marvel” (March 8):
 </strong>
 The latest ad for the superheroine vehicle starts like a gender-switch reboot of “Top Gun,” as Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) and a fellow female Air Force pilot (Lashana Lynch) bond over their mutual need for speed. The commercial introduces a new catchphrase — “higher, further, faster” — and lives up to it with a lightning-quick montage that sets pulses racing.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  “Avengers: Endgame” (April 26):
 </strong>
 “Where do we go, now that they’re gone?” reads a sign in this spot. Of course, the Avengers aren’t all gone, even though many of them disintegrated at the end of “Infinity War” last year. We get glimpses of some survivors, like Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Rocket Raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper). “Some people move on,” says Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), a.k.a. Captain America, “but not us.” Marvel fans won’t either, after this stirring teaser.

 — Jordan Peele was this year’s Super Bowl M.V.P. He appeared in an ad for his forthcoming CBS All Access remake of “The Twilight Zone,” rolled out another spot for his sophomore directorial effort, “Us,” and rejoined his old sketch-show pal Keegan-Michael Key to voice one of the stuffed animals who torment Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) in this amusing trailer for Pixar’s sequel. Does Peele ever sleep?

 After terrifying Christmas Day viewers with
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNCmb-4oXJA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  the first trailer
 </a>
 for his follow-up to “Get Out,” Peele scored more scares with the second clip. The focus is on Lupita Nyong’o as a mother whose family of four faces deadly doppelgängers while on a beach vacation from hell. There’s not a lot of new footage here, but the spot does debut a clever tagline: “Watch yourself.” Indeed.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  “Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark” (August):
 </strong>
 This quartet of 15-second mini-trailers is so dark and brief that it’s hard to tell what the hell’s going on, much less if it’s scary. The ads also promise that this adaptation of the best-selling young-adult books is “from Guillermo del Toro,” but the mastermind behind “The Shape of Water” only produced this movie — he didn’t direct it (that would be Andre Ovredal). Boo!
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  “Wonder Park” (March 15):
 </strong>
 “This is beginning to feel like a terrible turn of events for us all,” says John Oliver, perhaps all too aptly voicing a porcupine in this confusingly frenetic trailer for a cartoon about a young girl whose imaginary amusement park comes to life. Is riding on a fish carousel really a common fantasy among children? And what exactly are “chimpanzombies”? The flying moneys from “The Wizard of Oz” were creepy enough, thanks.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  “Alita: Battle Angel” (Feb. 14):
 </strong>
 Rosa Salazar plays the title role in this James Cameron-produced sci-fi drama, but the latest spot emphasizes Mahershala Ali — favored to win his second Oscar soon, for “Green Book” — as the film’s villain. In case you’re waiting to catch it on video, the ad declares, “Some things must be seen on the big screen” and this is the “must-see 3D cinematic event of the year.” Sorry, but this desperate Hail Mary pass of a trailer smells of flop sweat.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

 If movie studios needed another reminder that audiences are craving for new kinds of superpowered heroes, they got it this weekend.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Disney’s “Captain Marvel” rode a wave of enthusiasm for more diverse superheroes, a hunger for blockbusters at a quiet time of year and a large helping of ’90s nostalgia to sell $153 million in tickets in U.S. theaters over the weekend.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was easily the best stateside debut weekend of any movie this year as it breezily outperformed expectations and brought the domestic box office a much-needed boost.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Brie Larson-led movie’s opening weekend was the seventh best of any in the 21-film Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise, behind the $174.1 million brought in by “Iron Man 3” and just ahead of “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,” which made $146.5 million during its first weekend. (Topping that list: “Avengers: Infinity War,” which took in $257.7 million when it debuted.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Captain Marvel” is the

 during its opening weekend. While DC-Warner Bros. hired a single woman — Patty Jenkins — to direct “Wonder Woman,” Disney-Marvel’s movie split directing duties between Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, who wrote the script with Geneva Robertson-Dworet.

 An origin story whose soundtrack trades in the likes of Salt-N-Pepa and Nirvana, “Captain Marvel” is set principally in 1990s California, where Larson’s hero crash-lands and eventually teams up with Nicholas Fury, a government agent familiar to Marvel fans and here played by a younger-looking, digitally rejuvenated Samuel L. Jackson. Ben Mendelsohn, Jude Law, Annette Bening and Lashana Lynch play other major roles.

 “Captain Marvel” received fairly positive reviews —

 ). Whether the critics’ responses affect the new movie’s staying power remains to be seen, but its strong start is good news for Disney. The studio is also using “Captain Marvel” to drive up interest in “Avengers: Endgame,” the next entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that’s slated for release next month. That film will count Brie Larson’s newly-minted character among its ensemble of heroes, alongside Chris Evans’s Captain America, Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man, Mark Ruffalo’s Hulk, Chadwick Boseman’s Black Panther and others in what is essentially the popcorn movie equivalent of a musical supergroup.

  dark place

 , the DC cinematic super-universe has been as somber as a grave. There have been exceptions, shimmers of light amid the doom. Outside the animated realm, though, the stories and mood have been downbeat, matched by hues that range from drab to black amid bilious green, raging purple and watery blue. Even the “S” on Superman’s chest looks drained of cheer, more like dried blood than some candy-colored delight.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Given this, the bright, popping red of the superhero costume in “Shazam!” is an early warning sign, as obvious as a matador’s cape, that the dreary and crepuscular have given way to something less self-serious and end-of-the-world grim. It’s a nice change of pace for a big-screen mega-comic, if not a revolutionary shift. There are still a lot of brand shilling and the usual tediously overextended fights, ka-pow and ka-boom. But these are delivered via Shazam, a charmingly breezy avenger in tights once known as Captain Marvel, a.k.a. the World’s Mightiest Mortal, or as I thought of him going in:
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  Who
 </em>
 ?
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The answer emerges piecemeal in “Shazam!,” another movie about a superhero with dual-identity issues. Here, the divided self begins with Billy (Asher Angel, a relaxed, natural presence), a foundling with pluck, heart and a sob story. He’s on a mission to find his mother (longish story), a journey that — as sometimes happens in male quests — leads him to a surrogate father. This one is an ancient wizard called, ta-da, Wizard (Djimon Hounsou in a comic Halloween-ish get-up), who passes his magic to Billy. Once back in his normal realm, Billy discovers that he can tap great powers by saying the word “shazam,” which turns him into a hero with an adult body (Zachary Levi).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 If this sounds familiar — the Moses-like savior who learns he’s meant for greatness — it’s because the character was conceived to compete with Superman. Yet because Shazam isn’t as well known as Supes et al., he’s not as weighed down with fan expectations, the fate of the world and auteurist aspirations. The filmmakers (Henry Gayden wrote the script, David F. Sandberg directed) adhere to the heroic template, which means there’s a regulation villain (the reliably watchable Mark Strong) with schemes. But they also fill in the faces and places, and add enough shading and color to Billy’s world that when his inevitable fight against evil happens it feels as if something more than the box office is at stake.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Of course a franchise may be at stake, though considering how often the movie name drops Batman and Superman, it can’t help but feel as if the entire DC movie world is on the line. And maybe Shazam is a risk, just because he’s an unfamiliar avenger in a wildly overcrowded field. Created in 1939, the character was originally called Captain Marvel (and physically modeled on the actor Fred MacMurray). But for legal reasons, Captain Marvel went into storage only to be later resurrected by DC as Shazam. (DC’s longtime foe, Marvel Comics,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/03/captain-marvel-shazam-carol-danvers-guide" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="more">
  managed to trademark
 </a>
 the character’s first name for the avenger currently played by Brie Larson in “Captain Marvel.”)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The new movie quickly dusts off the Shazam story, first by grounding it in Billy, a sweet, if somewhat melancholic mischief maker who soon becomes an appealing protagonist. The opening scene involving a couple of dimwit cops feels as ancient as a
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/02/arts/huntz-hall-perpetual-youth-in-bowery-films-dies-at-78.html?module=inline" title="">
  Bowery Boys movie
 </a>
 , perhaps intentionally. Things soon settle into an easy, everyday groove when Billy moves into a new foster home, a sprawl populated by kids (Jack Dylan Grazer, among them) who are generally cute instead of cutesy. Tenderly overseen by Rosa and Victor (Marta Milans and Cooper Andrews), the house has a lived-in coziness, a warmth and security that feels as unforced as the mix of ethnicities and races.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Once Billy says that magic word and his supersized alter ego appears, the movie goes to its happy place and comfortably embraces its own identity as a light, jocular, modest entertainment. Levi is best known for his television roles (

 ), but he easily scales up for the big screen. He can look like a beefier, tougher

 </a>
 ; as Shazam, though, Levi is pure cartoon, from his bootblacked helmet of hair to his tumescent musculature. Ken-doll plastic and handsome, he is an ideal, suitably absurd figure on which to hang an old-fashioned hero with a satiny high-collared cape and a fat yellow arrow suggestively pointing down.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The arrow is a winking joke and as subtle as the nod to the
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/03/movies/review-film-tom-hanks-as-a-13-year-old-in-big.html?module=inline" title="a review">
  Tom Hanks body-swapping comedy “Big.”
 </a>
 It’s also a reminder of Billy’s larger human journey, a metamorphosis that remains humorously, identifiably awkward, even as he wills his inner super-adult to heroic life. Angel’s performance lays the groundwork for the character — and keeps him tethered to reality — while Levi lifts Shazam up with an exuberant turn that conveys the delight of Billy’s extreme transformation as well as its lingering adolescent ungainliness and excess. It’s one thing to fight evil, but Shazam’s eye-popping, slack-jawed, discordant physicality is a reminder that it’s just as tough to get a grip on yourself.

 LOS ANGELES — Warner Bros. has finally earned back the benefit of the doubt when it comes to its all-important superhero movies: “Shazam!” became the studio’s third nonsequel comic-book hit in a row over the weekend, arriving to

 “Shazam!” was the No. 1 movie in North America, collecting $53.5 million over the weekend, according to Comscore, which compiles box-office data.

 Second place at the domestic box office went to a remake of “Pet Sematary” (Paramount), based on the novel by Stephen King. It took in an estimated $25 million. Disney’s big-budget “Dumbo” trundled along in third place, selling $18.2 million in tickets, for a sad two-week total of $76.3 million.

 “Shazam!” was made by New Line, a division of Warner that focuses on lower-cost films that often serve as counterprogramming.

 “New Line always thought that ‘Big’ as a superhero movie was a great idea, a way to make the genre feel fresh and different,” Emmerich said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Warner has spent the better part of a decade trying to get its act together with movies based on characters from its DC Comics division — an imperative given the runaway success of rival Marvel Studios and the film industry’s increasing need for spectacles that audiences see as worth a trip to theaters. Part of the problem was that Warner stuck for too long with a dark vision for its superhero universe, set by the filmmaker Zack Snyder, that was
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://variety.com/2017/film/news/dc-films-justice-league-1202632214/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 </a>
 . That led to creative and financial messes like “Suicide Squad” and “Justice League.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But the studio, having largely jettisoned Snyder’s plans and shaken up its executive ranks, including

 , has started to deliver superhero home runs on a consistent basis: “Wonder Woman” from Patty Jenkins, “Aquaman” from James Wan, and seemingly “Shazam!,” which was directed by a relative newcomer, David F. Sandberg.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Where the PG-13 “Shazam!” will end up at the box office remains a bit of a question mark given the impending arrival of “Avengers: Endgame.” Ticket buyers gave “Shazam!” an A grade in CinemaScore exit polls, an indication of staying power.

The first episode introduces Murphy and her roommate, Jess (Brooke Markham), while setting up the pieces for the mystery: the possible murder of Murphy’s teenage friend, Tyson (Thamela Mpumlwana). While out for a walk, Murphy discovers what she believes to be Tyson’s body, but the police doubt her story; for one thing, the body is gone by the time the police arrive. So Murphy must take matters mostly into her own hands. The show was created by Corinne Kingsbury, who also created the sitcom “Fam,” which debuted on CBS this year.

 One thing we learn in “Captain Marvel” is that it’s pronounced MarVELL, like the English poet — or at least it used to be, on distant planets and right here on Earth, a windy rock also known as C-53. That was back in 1995, when most of this movie takes place and when the world as we know it had not yet been colonized by the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Yes, of course, Marvel Comics had been around for decades, but when the heroine crashes through the roof of the Blockbuster Video store, landing in between the “Family” and “Drama” sections, there are no Avengers or Iron-Man titles on the shelves.

  “The Right Stuff,”
 </a>
 which earns a mild chuckle, since while we know that she’s a space alien named Vers (rhymes with “cheers”), we also have reason to suspect that this young woman is connected with the United States Air Force, and maybe the space program, too, like the guys in that film. Also known as Carol Danvers, and played by Brie Larson, she has some of their bravado, and also — since she’s on the way to intergalactic superheroism — a righteous sense of mission and a burgeoning identity crisis.

 The last and least surprising thing we learn about her is that “Captain Marvel will return in ‘Avengers: Endgame,’” a scrappy little picture that will be released in seven weeks, if you can stand to wait that long. Directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck from a script they wrote with Geneva Robertson-Dworet, “Captain Marvel” is an origin story, which is to say a résumé check for the newest member of popular culture’s biggest, most heavily capitalized corporate team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 As such, it’s pretty good fun, and could almost be described without sarcasm as a scrappy little picture, like most of Boden and Fleck’s other work. (

</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And of course Samuel L. Jackson, who plays a young, two-eyed S.H.I.E.L.D. agent named Nicholas Fury. How Fury lost one of those eyes is the big spoiler to avoid here, and the character’s extended presence, after so many agitated cameos over the years, is a big part of the movie’s appeal. To watch the digitally rejuvenated Jackson riding around mid-90s Los Angeles, sort of like he did in “Pulp Fiction,” is to indulge in a bit of Gen-X nostalgia, a mood augmented by period-appropriate musical cues from Salt-N-Pepa, TLC and Nirvana.

 There are pay phones and pagers, too, and boxy government cars and all kinds of stuff that kids these days just don’t appreciate. Even the science-fiction elements have a mildly retro, “Star Trek: The Next Generation” feel. And the overall vibe, for all the fireballs and fisticuffs, is decidedly friendly. In addition to the Vers/Fury buddy-movie pairing, there is a best friend for Carol (a fellow pilot named Maria Rambeau, played by Lashana Lynch) and a succession of frenemies. Best of all, there is an orange cat.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The plot of “Captain Marvel,” for some reason, is another secret I’m supposed to keep. Which is fine. In spite of what some unhinged fans on social media might say, I was not paid by Disney to explain anything. Boden and Fleck were, and they do a perfectly adequate job. There’s a big war going on between the Kree — Vers’s people, at least as far as she knows — and the Skrull, green-skinned, pointy-eared beings who have the unnerving skill of turning into doppelgängers of anyone they see. Annette Bening is involved. We first see her as a manifestation of Supreme Intelligence, which seems accurate enough. I’ll say no more.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The twists in the story reveal a slyly anti-imperialist politics, which is both in keeping with the pluralist ethic of the Avengers cycle and just a bit subversive of the Disney-Marvel agenda of universal domination. The most sympathetic group of characters wants nothing more than to go somewhere else, to escape from the annihilating attention of their would-be conquerors. They might represent various oppressed and dispossessed earthly populations. They might also stand in for that portion of the movie audience that feels the cinematic universe shrinking around them.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Not that anyone can stop the Marvel Cinematic Universe from expanding. By now the contradictions of this gigantic enterprise are obvious enough. It’s inclusive and monopolistic, predatory and empowering. Every episode is unique — every hero is a complex individual with a singular back story — within an overall structure of sameness.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Filmmakers like Boden and Fleck, Ryan Coogler and Taika Waititi can put their own spin on a given story or hero, but at some point bolts or waves of orange or blue light will come shooting out of someone’s hands and someone else will be thrown backward and bounce off a wall. The protagonist’s costume will become a character in its own right. That protagonist — a tough and charming woman, in this case, determined to fight gender clichés at least to a draw — will be ready for a career of franchise clock-punching, along with the rest of us. You will stay through the very last credits in the hope of collecting every last Easter egg, and you’ll shuffle out of the theater feeling both satisfied and empty.

 (Reuters) - World number one Novak Djokovic took out his frustration on the racket in a scrappy performance but did enough to overcome German Philipp Kohlschreiber in a 6-3 4-6 6-4 win in the second round of the Monte Carlo Masters on Tuesday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Serb, who received a first round bye, clinched the first set with penetrating groundstrokes from the baseline but struggled with his serve in the second and serving at 2-3 down was forced to save two break points.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 On the third break point opportunity for Kohlschreiber, Djokovic inexplicably hit a backhand volley wide to put his opponent 4-2 ahead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 A furious Djokovic went on to smash his racket three times on the court and was met with a chorus of boos from the spectators.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Two-times winner Djokovic would go on to drop his serve for the fourth time in the set but regained his composure with an early break in the decider.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He maintained the advantage to avenge his Indian Wells second-round defeat by Kohlschreiber last month.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "There were lots of ups and downs. It was not the prettiest of matches," Djokovic, who record his 850th tour-level win, said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "He played well, but a win is a win. This was a tough first match of the clay season.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "I had to figure out how I needed to move, this kind of match can be expected. It was probably good for me to spend so long on the court."
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Argentine Guido Pella knocked out seventh seed Marin Cilic, beating the Croatian 6-3 5-7 6-1.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The defeat left 2014 U.S. Open winner Cilic with just one victory from five matches since January's Australian Open, where he was knocked out in the fourth round.

 BURBANK, Calif. — The Walt Disney Company has been talking about plans to start a Netflix-style streaming service for two years. On Thursday came the big reveal.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D-Day, as some in Hollywood called it.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In a lavish presentation on the Disney lot, Robert A. Iger, Disney’s chief executive, offered long-awaited details about his counterattack on the tech giants that have moved into the entertainment business. The linchpin is Disney Plus, a
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/05/business/media/disney-streaming-service-ricky-strauss.html?module=inline" title="">
  new subscription video service
 </a>
 dedicated to movies and shows from Disney, Pixar, the “Star Wars” franchise, National Geographic and Marvel.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Disney Plus will cost $7 a month and arrive on Nov. 12. (Netflix’s cheapest plan is $9, and its standard plan is $13.) Disney said it intended to roll out the streaming service in Europe and Asia starting next year. It expects subscribers to total 60 million to 90 million by 2024.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “We are all-in,” Mr. Iger said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In its first year, Disney Plus will offer 10 original films and 25 original series, including three “Avengers” spinoffs. Disney announced that all 30 seasons of “The Simpsons” would be available on Day One, along with nearly all the “Star Wars” movies, the entire Pixar library and family-focused movies and shows from its Fox library like “The Sound of Music” and “Malcolm in the Middle.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 To market Disney Plus, the company vowed to use the full reach of its empire as it has never done before, starting with a “Star Wars” fan convention in Chicago this weekend. Disney will also mobilize its cruise line, global theme parks, retail stores, hotels and television networks, including ESPN and ABC.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The presentation, inside Soundstage 2, home to the
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://d23.com/this-day/the-walt-disney-studios-is-rededicated/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  original “Mickey Mouse Club,”
 </a>
 began with a 14-minute sizzle reel highlighting Disney’s vast library, which now includes Fox movies like “Titanic,” “Avatar” and “Alien.” Mr. Iger called the library “a treasure trove of long-lasting, valuable content” that “no other content or technology company can rival.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. Iger added, “It was important to remind you that we’re starting from a position of strength, confidence and unbridled optimism.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The moment amounted to a turning point in the streaming wars. For the first time, a traditional media company demonstrated the firepower needed to compete with Silicon Valley in the fast-growing realm of online video.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Disney’s plans could have failed to impress, along the lines of what happened to Apple last month when it staged a similar event focused on its streaming ambitions. Apple

  few specifics
 </a>
 — nothing on pricing, no launch date, barely any footage.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Disney has a mixed track record with technology, struggling to find a winning strategy with video games and failing to capitalize on tech-related
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/25/business/media/disney-buys-maker-studios-video-supplier-for-youtube.html?module=inline" title="">
  acquisitions like Maker
 </a>
 , a YouTube-based video supplier.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Unlike Apple, Disney unveiled footage from original shows and films that are headed to Disney Plus. One live-action series is called “The Mandalorian.” Set in the “Star Wars” universe and created by Jon Favreau, the show cost an estimated $100 million for 10 episodes, on a par with earlier seasons of HBO’s extravagant “Game of Thrones.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Disney also demonstrated the Disney Plus app. The simple user interface, with movie and television tiles arranged against a dark background, will look familiar to any Netflix, Amazon or Hulu user. There will be “recommended for you” rows of suggested shows and movies, as well as the option to “continue watching” programs.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 There will be tiles dedicated to the Disney brands, including Pixar, ‘Star Wars’ and National Geographic. Each time a user hovers over a brand tile, an animated image is set off — fireworks blasting behind the Magic Kingdom for the Disney tile or a comic book flip for Marvel.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Users can make a personalized avatar using characters from Disney’s intellectual property, including Buzz Lightyear and Moana.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 While the three-and-a-half-hour presentation’s target audience was Wall Street — analysts were invited to attend — the presentation was also aimed at potential Disney Plus subscribers. Disney also discussed its broader streaming business, which includes Hulu, ESPN Plus and Hotstar, which has 300 million monthly active users in India.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Disney will “likely” bundle its disparate services at a discounted price, according to Kevin Mayer, chairman of the company’s Direct-to-Consumer and International division. Mr. Mayer said that Disney was “actively evaluating” international strategies for Hulu, which currently operates exclusively in the United States. (Unlike Netflix.)
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Will Disney greatly expand Hulu’s budget? Randy Freer, the chief executive of Hulu, said it planned to expand original programs but did not say by how much.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 With Disney’s acquisition of much of 21st Century Fox, it now owns 60 percent of Hulu, giving the service a majority owner for the first time in its history. (The other companies with ownership stakes include Comcast, at 30 percent, and AT&amp;T’s Warner Media.) Hulu now has 25 million subscribers. Disney said it expected Hulu’s subscriber number to reach 40 million to 60 million in five years, and to be profitable by 2023 or 2024.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Most analysts have sky-high expectations for Disney Plus, which the company styles as Disney+.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Our confidence in the resilient success of Disney+ comes from the company’s unmatched brand recognition, extensive premium content and unparalleled ecosystem to market the service,” Alexia Quadrani, an analyst at J.P. Morgan, wrote in a recent report. Bank of Montreal and Cowen and Company both upgraded Disney’s stock ahead of Thursday’s presentation.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. Iger has spent years laying the groundwork for Disney Plus. In 2015, as Netflix grew at a blistering rate, Disney began experimenting overseas with an app called DisneyLife. Rolled out in Britain, DisneyLife offered old movies and television series, children’s e-books, games and music. Without new movies, or at least exclusive content, interest was limited.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 2016 Mr. Iger started talking more openly about needing to develop a streaming business — a risky proposition for a company with vast traditional television holdings. Disney paid $1 billion for a 33 percent stake in BamTech, a
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/08/business/media/bamtech-disney-streaming.html?module=inline" title="">
  streaming services company
 </a>
 , eventually paying $1.58 billion more for majority control.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. Iger announced in summer 2017 that Disney would
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/08/business/media/disney-streaming-service.html?module=inline" title="">
  introduce its own
 </a>
 Netflix-style service and stop selling movie rerun rights to Netflix, forgoing hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. In 2018 came Disney’s $71.3 billion purchase of 21st Century Fox assets, including National Geographic and the Fox movie studio. Mr. Iger positioned the acquisition as supercharging Disney’s move into streaming.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Michael Nathanson, a media analyst at MoffettNathanson, estimated in a report on Tuesday that Disney Plus could lose as much as $1.8 billion annually through 2023, with programming as one major expense. Add in losses from Hulu and ESPN Plus and Mr. Nathanson expects Disney’s streaming division to lose roughly $3.8 billion this year and next.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 At least nine new movies are in production or advanced development for Disney Plus, with budgets ranging from $20 million to $60 million. Disney is remaking two musicals from its animation library as live-action films: “Lady and the Tramp” (1955) and “The Sword in the Stone” (1963). Other new movies include “Togo,” a period adventure about a sled dog; “Noelle,” starring Anna Kendrick as Santa’s daughter; and an animated “Phineas and Ferb” movie.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Marvel Studios is working on three Disney Plus shows. One will focus on Loki from the “Avengers” movies, with Tom Hiddleston reprising the role. Another “Avengers” star, Elizabeth Olsen, will reprise her Scarlet Witch character in a second series. A third show will be associated with “Captain America: The Winter Soldier,” with Anthony Mackie returning as the Falcon.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Also in the works are episodic spinoffs of Disney franchises like “High School Musical” and “Monsters, Inc.” Additionally, Disney is working on 10 unscripted shows, including a Disney-themed cooking competition, “Be Our Chef,” and a series called “Encore!” that reunites the casts of high school musicals long after graduation and asks them to recreate their performance.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Roughly 500 films from Disney’s library, including new movies like “Captain Marvel,” and 7,500 episodes of old Disney-branded television shows like “Hannah Montana” will anchor Disney Plus.

</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 WELLINGTON, New Zealand — New Zealand's government did not approve an aid agency's decision to release the name of a New Zealand nurse held captive by the Islamic State group in Syria, the country's foreign minister said Tuesday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Foreign Minister Winston Peters said an International Committee of the Red Cross official's claim to have acted with New Zealand's agreement was "balderdash." He said New Zealand opposed any steps that might endanger 62-year-old midwife and nurse Louisa Akavi or impede her location and release.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "That's a very polite way of describing how one person has, in my view, dropped the ball so to speak," Peters said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The ICRC said it believed it had New Zealand's support for its decision to allow the New York Times on Sunday to publish the name and nationality Akavi, who was taken prisoner in northwest Syria in 2013.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ever since her capture, successive New Zealand governments and the ICRC maintained an agreement with international media to keep secret the nurse's name and nationality.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 New Zealand feared naming Akavi would make her a high profile captive, more likely to be executed by her captors for propaganda. More recently ISIS has vowed to avenge a March 15 attack that left 50 dead at two mosques in New Zealand and Akavi's nationality could make her a target for retribution.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 ICRC director of operations Dominik Stillhart said he believed the agency had acted with New Zealand's agreement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We would not have made that decision without the support of the New Zealand Government," he said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The aid group reasoned that with the collapse of the Islamic State group, naming Akavi would raise the chance of receiving news of her whereabouts and those of the two Syrian drivers kidnapped with her.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The agency said it had received information that Akavi may have been seen alive as recently as December.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Monday indicated her disappointment with the ICRC's decision to release the nurse's name and also said the government had not given its blessing to reveal that information.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Peters said he didn't want to get engaged in a dispute with the ICRC and have the search for Akavi detoured by it.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He said New Zealand had shared information with the ICRC throughout Akavi's captivity and there had been times when rescue teams had come close to the location at which she was being held.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "The fact of the matter is we went there looking for someone in the most extremely difficult, changing circumstances and we've never given up hope and we're not giving up hope now," he said.

 BEIJING — China's exports rebounded in March but imports shrank for a fourth straight month and at a sharper pace, painting a mixed picture of the economy as trade talks with the United States reach their endgame.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Investors are hoping for signs of economic recovery in China to temper worries about slowing global growth, after the IMF this week downgraded its 2019 world outlook for the third time.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But veteran China watchers had said export gains may be due more to seasonal factors than any sudden turnaround in lacklustre global demand, as shipments were expected to jump after long holidays in February.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 March exports rose 14.2 percent from a year earlier, customs data showed on Friday, the strongest growth in five months. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 7.3 percent gain after February's 20.8 percent plunge.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Shipments picked up around 3 percent month-on-month, suggesting some improvement in foreign demand, Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, said in a note. But he said exports have yet to fully recover from a sharp slowdown late last year.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "With global growth set to remain weak in the coming quarters, a strong rebound in exports looks unlikely," he said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Adding to the worries, China's imports fell more than expected, suggesting its domestic demand remains weak.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Imports fell 7.6 percent from a year earlier, worse than analysts' forecasts for a 1.3 percent fall and widening from February's 5.2 percent drop.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 That left the country with a trade surplus of $32.64 billion for the month, according to Reuters calculations based on the official data, much larger than forecasts of $7.05 billion (£5.4 billion).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In the first quarter, exports rose 1.4 percent from a year earlier, while imports fell 4.8 percent.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 A customs spokesman said he expects mild growth in both exports and imports in the current quarter.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 China also released lending data on Friday that, unlike trade, was unambiguously strong.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Chinese banks extended 1.69 trillion yuan ($251.59 billion) in net new yuan loans in March, up sharply from February and far more than expected, as policymakers push bankers to keep lending to struggling smaller companies, even at the risk of more bad loans.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Total bank lending in the first three months of 2019 hit a record quarterly tally of 5.81 trillion yuan, suggesting months of policy loosening by the central bank are starting to bear fruit.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Strong credit growth is likely to reinforce analysts' views that the economy will stabilise later in the year after a rocky first half.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 TENTATIVE SIGNS OF RECOVERY
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 China factory surveys for March had provided some glimmers of hope that demand was improving at home and abroad, suggesting government stimulus measures may be starting to take hold.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 While export orders remained sluggish, there were signs that a long spell of contraction was easing even as trade talks with the United States appeared to be making progress.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Washington and Beijing have largely agreed on a mechanism to police any trade agreement they reach, including establishing new "enforcement offices," U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 However, a top White House official said on Monday the U.S. side is "not satisfied yet" about all the issues standing in the way of a deal to end the U.S.-China trade war.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 President Donald Trump said last week that an agreement could be reached in about four weeks.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But economists warn that even if a deal is reached, and both sides rescind tit-for-tat tariffs, Chinese exporters will still have to contend with weakening demand globally.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The International Monetary Fund trimmed its 2019 global growth forecast this week to 3.3 percent, while slightly boosting its forecast for China to 6.3 percent, in part because the Sino-U.S. trade war did not escalate as much as expected.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Chinese exporters will also likely have to scramble to win back lost market share.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The trade dispute has prompted some U.S. firms to shift purchases of tariff-targeted products like furniture and refrigerators to countries such as Vietnam, South Korea, Taiwan and Mexico, according to a report by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence's trade data firm Panjiva.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 China's trade surplus with the United States, a major source of frustration for Washington, rose nearly 40 percent in March from February to $20.5 billion and hit $62.66 billion in the first quarter.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 SHRINKING IMPORTS
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 On imports, analysts said companies may not be restocking inventories as much as usual due to concerns over the longer-term economic outlook and global trade, though an infrastructure push is likely to see imports of raw materials improve.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Slackening demand has sent corporate profits into a tailspin, which could curb the fresh investment that Beijing is counting on to fuel an economic revival.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Policymakers have acknowledged the economy is under pressure as multi-year debt and pollution crackdown have deterred investment, while the trade war is increasingly hurting China's exporters and their domestic supply chains.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In response, Beijing has announced more spending on roads, railways and ports, along with trillions of yuan of tax cuts to ease pressure on corporate balance sheets and avert a sharper economic slowdown. State-controlled banks are also being urged to keep lending to companies that are struggling.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Investors are closely watching to see how long it will take those support measures to take hold. But analysts believe China will still need to loosen policy further in coming months to ensure a sustained economic turnaround.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 China's economic growth is expected to cool to around 6.3 percent in the first quarter of the year and may not bottom out until later in the year, according to a Reuters poll. The economy grew 6.6 percent last year, a 28-year low.

  The Associated Press
 </span>
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 SAN FRANCISCO — Disney raised the curtain on a hotly anticipated video steaming service that's aiming to topple industry pioneer Netflix, once a valuable ally of the Magic Kingdom.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The service, called Disney Plus, has been in the works for more than year, but Thursday marked the first time that the longtime entertainment powerhouse has laid out plans for its attack on Netflix and a formidable cast of competitors, including Amazon, HBO Go and Showtime Anytime.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Disney Plus will roll out in the U.S. on November 12 at a price of $6.99 per month, or $69.99 per year. That's well below the $13 monthly fee Netflix charges for its most popular streaming plan, signaling Disney's determination to woo subscribers as it vies to become a major player in a field that has turned "binge watching" into a common ritual.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Like Netflix, Disney Plus will be free of ads. Subscribers will be able to download all of the shows and movies on Disney's service to watch offline.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Netflix will still have a far deeper video programming lineup after spending tens of billions of dollars during the past six years on original shows such as "House of Cards," ''Stranger Things" and "The Crown."
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But Disney Plus will be able to draw upon a library of revered films dating back several decades while it also forges into original programming. Its animated classics, including "Aladdin" and "The Jungle Book" will be available on the service when it launches.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 New shows already on tap include "The Mandalorian," the first live action "Star Wars" series, created by Jon Favreau; a prequel to the "Star Wars" film "Rogue One," starring Diego Luna; a series about the Marvel character Loki, starring Tom Hiddleston; a rebooted "High School Musical" series; and a new documentary series focused on Disney.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Disney is approaching the streaming industry from a "position of strength, confidence and unbridled optimism," CEO Bob Iger said Thursday. Iger has led the company since 2005 and expects to step down when his contract ends in 2021.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The service's entire lineup will cover five categories: Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Although Disney has an enviable track record of producing shows and films that attract huge audiences, its attempt to build its own Netflix is risky. To make the leap, Disney ended a lucrative licensing relationship with Netflix, which had become the video streaming home for its latest films after their theatrical release, as well as many of its TV series and classic movies.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But now movies that came out in 2019, and going forward, will be streamed only on Disney Plus. That includes "Captain Marvel," which came out earlier this year; "Avengers: Endgame," which debuts in late April; and the upcoming "Toy Story 4," live-action movies "The Lion King" and "Aladdin;" and "Star Wars Episode IX."
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In many ways, it's hard to compare Netflix with Disney because of the widely different types of shows each offers, said eMarketer analyst Paul Verna.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "The interesting thing is both companies have ended up in the same place, but they've come to it from vastly different backgrounds," he said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Disney will also contend with a new streaming service from Apple, which is expected to be released in the fall. Apple has not yet said how much its service will cost or when exactly it will launch.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Last month, Disney completed its biggest deal yet with its $71 billion acquisition of Fox's entertainment business. The first 30 seasons of "The Simpsons" will now stream exclusively on Disney Plus.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Fox takeover helps Disney tighten its control over TV shows and movies from start to finish — from creating the programs to distributing them though television channels, movie theaters, streaming services and other avenues. Disney will also get valuable data on customers and their entertainment-viewing habits, which it can then use to sell advertising.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Fox deal also gave Disney a controlling stake in Hulu. Iger has said Hulu will continue to offer general entertainment programming while Disney Plus will be focused on family fare.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Along with its strong brand, Disney has the advantage of having a clear strategy for each of its streaming services, Verna said, including Disney Plus, Hulu and ESPN Plus. Disney executives hinted the company would "likely" bundle the three at a discounted price, but declined to give more details.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Terminating its deal with Netflix will cost Disney about $150 million in licensing revenue alone during its current fiscal year ending in September.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Disney is betting its new service will quickly offset that. By dangling a mix of familiar franchises and beloved animated classics, along with original programming, it figures the new service will be irresistible to families, even if they already subscribe to other services. It expects Disney Plus to be profitable during its 2024 fiscal year.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The plunge into video streaming is likely to confront Disney with new challenges. One of the biggest dilemmas will center on how long Disney waits after a new film's theatrical release to make it available on its new streaming service.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Disney said movies would become available on its streaming service only after the traditional theatrical release period and home movie debut, which includes DVDs and purchasing streaming videos. That puts its schedule behind that of some competitors. Netflix films such as the award-winning "Roma" and "The Ballad of Buster Scruggs" have either become available for streaming on the same day or just a few days after their short runs in theaters.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 With nearly 140 million worldwide subscribers, Netflix already has proven its mettle while warding off one competitive threat after another in the 12 years since it pivoted from DVD-by-mail rentals to video streaming.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Now, Netflix is locking horns with a company that has been steadily expanding upon its Disney franchise during a shopping spree that has seen it snap up other major studios.

 At the “Captain Marvel” premiere in Los Angeles last month, Brie Larson

 in a sequined Rodarte slip dress, a galaxy of diamonds cradling her ears. A squadron of F-16 fighter jets flew overhead as fans cheered the movie’s star as she climbed steps to a stage where she was interviewed by Lorraine Cink.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ms. Cink, a self-described comic book geek and red carpet host, did not ask Ms. Larson about her gown as others did that day. Nor did she discuss
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://time.com/5403533/brie-larson-captain-marvel-smile/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  the movie’s internet trolls

 </a>
 in Hollywood. Instead she focused solely on Captain Marvel and her alter ego Carol Danvers, a United States Air Force pilot, played by Ms. Larson.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Carol changed my life and this movie hasn’t even come out yet,” Ms. Larson said, as she held back tears.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Red carpet interviews from the premiere were
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8reT9_rMmI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  streamed live for fans
 </a>
 who could not attend. And the show was as slickly produced as any pre-awards festivities, albeit one that edged toward camp at times. (For starters, Ms. Cink’s co-host
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.marvel.com/watch/digital-series/marvel-live/goose-the-cat-gets-ready-for-the-captain-marvel-red-carpet" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

  several that played Goose
 </a>
 in the movie.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ms. Cink is an employee of Marvel Studios, which produced Captain Marvel. And if there is any question why the studio would air the red carpet live, consider this: The live stream has been watched more than 485,000 times on YouTube alone.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Fans today clamor for anything related to their favorite movies and television franchises. As a result, live-streaming from the red carpet is not just for the Oscars anymore. More studios are producing their own red carpet extravaganzas, hiring battalions of brand-friendly hosts to market the studio’s offerings and control social media messaging. And with technology that makes live-steaming easy, new players have joined the fray to take advantage of the summer blockbuster season and its worldwide audience.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Movie premieres have become global moments,” said Doug Neil, Universal Pictures executive vice president for digital marketing. “Fans like to feel like they are part of the experience.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. Neil would know. Last year the studio held only one premiere in London for “Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again.” With an army of Academy Award winners on the red carpet — including Meryl Streep, Colin Firth, Tom Hanks and Cher — the event would be difficult for Universal to reproduce elsewhere, he said. Premieres are expensive, too, sometimes costing $100,000 or more. So
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.facebook.com/MammaMiaMovie/videos/10155481261222665/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  the festivities in London were live-streamed
 </a>
 on Facebook, where they were viewed more than 451,000 times around the world.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “The talent bench was so deep,” Mr. Neil said of the celebrities who attended. “And Facebook has our largest community of fans.” With streaming technology, he added, “It’s very easy to flip a switch.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The quality, though, can depend on whose hand is on the switch. “When we started doing this, it was iPhones on tripods,” said Alison Hoffman, chief marketing officer for the cable channel Starz. Now, she said, the company teams up with media outlets, like Entertainment Weekly, People and Entertainment Tonight, to host live stream red carpet events. That was the case last June at the premiere of “Power” at Radio City Music Hall in Manhattan. The channel
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.facebook.com/Power.Starz/videos/1953785251341056/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  broadcast a live stream
 </a>
 with three video cameras.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “For the right show, it’s a critical part of the mix,” Ms. Hoffman said.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 That is not always the case, though. Last week, the cast of “Game of Thrones” gathered at Radio City Music Hall for the final red carpet premiere for the beloved HBO show. The spectacle was
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDecnF7kR2I" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  broadcast live
 </a>
 by NowThis, a social media content company, which streamed unscripted, raw footage from the “Game of Thrones” press line. An HBO executive said the company was neither involved in nor aware of the live stream, which explains why it had none of the polish of a typical HBO affair.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Photographers could be heard booing when Sophie Turner, who plays Sansa Stark, invited Joe Jonas, her pop star fiancé, to join her on the red carpet. “How about a kiss?” a man shouted at Lisa Bonet, the wife of Jason Momoa, who delighted as the he-man Khal Drogo in Season 1. Ms. Bonet shook her head no; her husband was visibly annoyed.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The video itself was sketchy, too. The camera shook and the Wi-Fi was unreliable. Gwendoline Christie looked fetching in a flowing yellow gown until she waved her silken sleeves and the screen disappeared into a haze of pixelated squares. Still, the live stream has been watched more than 188,000 times on YouTube.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “It’s not always the best quality that gets the most eyeballs,” said Tina Exarhos, the chief content officer of NowThis. “When you are on a red carpet, these are the moments you look for.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Despite the video’s raw quality, she added, “We are looking to do more and more of these with studios.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Walt Disney Studios, which oversees Lucasfilm, Marvel Studios, Pixar and its own slate of movies, has the most sophisticated live-streaming operation in Hollywood. Lylle Breier, who oversees premieres and special events for the studio, said there were often multiple hosts — some on stages, others on the red carpet — and several cameras used for interviews.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The movies that attract the most attention are the “Star Wars” and Marvel franchises. Last April’s red carpet premiere for “Avengers: Infinity War,” for example,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=5208&amp;v=gbRijjvIeyk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  has been watched 7.28 million times
 </a>
 . There, Gwyneth Paltrow plugged her company, Goop. (“She did a Goop detox and she’s fine,” she said of her stressed-out character, Pepper Potts.) Ms. Paltrow also admitted to never having watched an “Avengers” movie.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 As many as 30 people are hired to produce a live-streamed red carpet show for a Disney company premiere. And hosts, like Ms. Cink, have jobs mostly because they are fans. “They do not ask reporter-type questions,” Ms. Breier said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ms. Cink has hosted at least six streaming red carpet premieres and writes all her own questions. She copped to being flustered by only one celebrity: Stan Lee, the force behind Marvel Comics. (Mr. Lee
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/obituaries/stan-lee-dead.html?module=inline" title="">
  died in November
 </a>
 , and “Captain Marvel” carries a dedication to him, as well as a montage of his movie cameos in the Marvel logo.)
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Her background in improvisational theater is helpful, she said. Once her earpiece quit working during a live shot, which made it impossible to hear.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “I looked like a deer in the headlights,” she said. “I screamed my intro. I know I looked, like, cuckoo bananas. And it was completely live. I was kicking off the whole show.”

</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - The magic word at the box office this weekend was "Shazam!" Warner Bros.' latest DC superhero adventure easily topped charts in North America, pocketing $53 million when it debuted in 4,217 venues.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Buoyed by positive reviews, "Shazam!" arrived ahead of expectations, which anticipated a start around $40 million to $45 million. The film, made by Warner Bros.' New Line division, also earned $3 million in advanced screenings, bringing its domestic haul to $56 million. Overseas, "Shazam!" dominated with $102 million from 79 international markets for a global start to $158.6 million.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 While "Shazam!'s" domestic opening weekend is on the lower side for a traditional comic-book movie, it was significantly less expensive to make compared to other films in the genre that are heavy on special effects. That means "Shazam!" doesn't have to reach the same box office heights as other DC Comic entries like "Aquaman" and "Wonder Woman" to turn a profit. Warner Bros. and New Line spent $98 million to produce "Shazam!," proving that studios can crank out a solid superhero installment without breaking the bank. Prior DC films like "Justice League" and "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," on the other hand, cost upward of $300 million before taking marketing and distribution into count.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Jeff Goldstein, Warner Bros. president of domestic distribution, said this weekend's "thrilling result" was because "Shazam!" doesn't take itself too seriously. Though it's still in the superhero genre, it feels lighter in tone than the influx of comic-book titles in theaters. "It was about having fun," he said.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "'Wonder Woman and 'Aquaman' were very dark and dramatic and different," Goldstein added. "It shows we're making a variety of different movies that can all live in the same space." "Shazam!" -- described as "Big" meets "Superman" -- centers on Billy Baston (Asher Angel), a teenager who transforms into a superhero (Zachary Levi) when someone says the magic word. Both critics and fans praised the movie for its lighter take on the genre, compared to the apocalyptic storylines in comic-book adaptations. Moviegoers awarded with an A CinemaScore. Males accounted for 57 percent of opening weekend audiences, while 45 percent of crowds were under the age of 25.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Though "Shazam!" led the way in North America, Paramount's horror remake "Pet Sematary" also had a strong start, scaring up $25 million when it debuted in 3,585 locations. The supernatural thriller, based on Stephen King's novel, cost $21 million to produce.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "Pet Sematary" holds an 61 percent on Rotten Tomatoes and a C+ CinemaScore. Starring Jason Clarke, Amy Seimetz, and John Lithgow, the film follows a family who, upon moving to rural Maine, discovers their new home is located near a mysterious burial ground that sets off a chain of horrific events. Audiences were 52 percent male, with 58 percent of ticket buyers over the age of 25.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "Pet Sematary" came in at the higher end of expectations. Paramount's domestic distribution chief Kyle Davies says moviegoers latched onto the movie because it challenges audiences.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "Spring suddenly got very competitive. I think this rose above the fray because it's one of Stephen King's most popular books and the filmmakers did a great job delivering the scares," Davies said. "They really paid respect to the original source material, but added some new twists."
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The final newcomer this weekend was "Best of Enemies," starring Taraji P. Henson and Sam Rockwell as a civil rights activist and a KKK leader forced to work together. It pulled in an underwhelming $4.5 million from 1,705 screens. Astute Films fully financed the film, which was distributed by STXfilms. Older moviegoers aren't generally a demographic that rushes out to see a movie on opening weekend, so the studio anticipates that word of mouth about the feel-good drama will grow in the coming weeks, leading to a long life in theaters. Nearly 80 percent of moviegoers were over the age of 25, and 63 percent were female.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 A number of holdovers filled out North American box office charts. In third place, Disney's re-imagining of "Dumbo" earned $18.2 million in its sophomore outing, marking a steep 60 percent drop from its debut. Directed by Tim Burton, the remake of Disney's 1941 classic has surpassed $200 million globally, including $76 million in North America.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Universal and Jordan Peele's "Us," now in its third weekend of release, amassed another $13 million for a domestic haul of $152 million. The psychological thriller, starring Lupita Nyong'o and Winston Duke, hit $200 million in ticket sales worldwide.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rounding out the top five is Disney's "Captain Marvel," adding $12.7 million. Starring Brie Larson, the superhero tentpole has crossed $1 billion in ticket sales, with $373 million of that bounty coming from North American theaters.

 Among specialty releases, Neon's Aretha Franklin documentary "Amazing Grace" made $57,353 from three theaters, averaging $19,118 per location. The non-fiction film, which was 46 years in the making, captures the Queen of Soul as she records her wildly successful album in a Baptist church.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Elsewhere, Amazon Studio's released "Peterloo," a historical drama about the deadly 1819 massacre in Manchester, in three locations. It pocketed $30,426 for a per-screen-average of $10,142.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This weekend continued to prove that scares and superheroes are some of the most reliable money-makers at the box office. Overall, ticket sales are still pacing around 16 percent behind last year, according to Comscore. That gap is shrinking as films like "Captain Marvel" and "Us" impress audiences, and Marvel's "Avengers: Endgame," the studio's epic conclusion that is expected to shatter records, could help close that margin even more.

 In a recording studio in Williamsburg, Brooklyn last month, where wood paneling on the walls and ceiling gave off the faint scent of pine,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.charlierosen.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Charlie Rosen
 </a>
 stood in front of 17 fellow musicians, smiling. Chiefly known for his work on Broadway, Mr. Rosen bopped along to the music, baton comfortably in hand, while the ensemble played the score of a Nintendo racecar game.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 With a TV on mute providing cues, he and his 8-Bit Big Band were recording the music from Mario Kart 64, blown way out with 36 instruments, including saxophones, trumpets, trombones, 11 violins, three cellos and a harp.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “You got everything we need for that section?” he asked his engineer. “Great. Let’s move on to Level 3.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 At 28, Mr. Rosen is an orchestrator, composer and arranger with his hands in many musical cookie jars.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He is the music supervisor and orchestrator for Broadway’s “Be More Chill,” a show for which he also plays guitar in the pit. He has one big band devoted to video game songs and another devoted to theater music, which will perform
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://54below.com/events/charlie-rosens-broadway-big-band-4/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  at Feinstein’s/54 Below
 </a>
 on Monday.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. Rosen also produces commercial soundtracks for the skin care company Olay out of his tiny home office in Harlem, where he stashes 52 instruments in a 9-foot-by-10-foot room that overlooks a quiet side street.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 There’s a melodica, a flugelbone, a zither and a
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSzTPGlNa5U" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  theremin
 </a>
 , which makes the ooo-oo-ooo sound from old sci-fi movies and is played by waving your hands around in the air. If you count what he calls his “toys” — like harmonicas, tambourines and a kalimba — Mr. Rosen has 70 instruments at home. He can play them all.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “That’s insane,” he said after counting. “I’m insane.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This collection represents more than a nifty party trick. Indeed, while he considers himself primarily a bass player, his facility with so many instruments is part of what makes him such a valuable orchestrator.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “It’s kind of like cooking,” he added. “The more spices you’re familiar with, the more you can combine them to create new flavors in places you might not expect.” Once a year, he estimates, he’ll be working on piece of music and think, “You know what this needs? A bass melodica.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. Rosen exists as a sort of bridge between genres and generations, embracing Broadway standards, pop songs and the music of
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV7GijG9ZWY" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Tetris
 </a>
 . And all of it funnels into his work.

 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://variety.com/2018/artisans/production/mary-poppins-returns-songs-1203032562/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Marc Shaiman,
 </a>
 a Tony-winning theater and Oscar-nominated film composer, described Mr. Rosen as a big talent, but without the eccentricities that sometimes come along for the ride. “It’s the kind of talent where I almost want to hate him,” Mr. Shaiman said. “But I can’t.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Jennifer Ashley Tepper, a producer on “Be More Chill” and the creative and programming director of Feinstein’s/54 Below, described him as a hub for young Broadway musicians, since, between his bands and the shows for which he hires, he employs so many of them.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “He’s an unbelievably calm and steadying source,” Ms. Tepper said. “When you find out that a big press person is coming, or that something has fallen apart and we can’t put it back together, he’s the first person to be like, ‘O.K., let’s come up with a plan.’”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. Rosen, an easy-to-smile bundle of bearded energy, has lived in the same six-bedroom Harlem apartment since he was 22, with a rotating cast of roommates. His girlfriend, Danielle Gimbal, does the copy work for his music and is a frequent presence in his home and at recording sessions.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Raised in Los Angeles, Mr. Rosen is the son of a classical bassoonist (his mother, who also plays flute, clarinet, piccolo and sax) and an organist (his father, who also plays guitar, banjo and accordion). A full sized Wurlitzer pipe organ, the kind from silent-movie houses, sat in his childhood home.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When he was 3, his parents noticed he could tell if a note played on the piano was white or black — he had perfect pitch. So he started on the piano, with his mother as his first teacher.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He didn’t set out to work on Broadway. But as a 15-year-old jazz student at a performing arts high school, he auditioned to play in the pit for a regional production of the musical “13” — and off he went.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He attended Berklee College of Music in Boston for four semesters, on and off between Broadway shows. He gravitated to courses he felt would help him professionally, like music production, arranging and Afro-Caribbean percussion.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 His main gigs now are playing guitar for “Be More Chill” — his instrument, dressed for the occasion, wears a brown hair bow on its headstock — and co-orchestrating the production of
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/19/theater/moulin-rouge-the-musical-broadway.html?module=inline" title="">
  “Moulin Rouge!” scheduled to open on Broadway in July
 </a>
 . (On the first day of performances for “Be More Chill,” he was told by his union’s new leadership that contract
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Update-Local-802-Responds-to-Dispute-with-BE-MORE-CHILL-Orchestrator-20190220" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  rules
 </a>
 prohibited him, as the show’s orchestrator, from playing in the band, but he was put back in while the contract is being renegotiated.)
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Thanks to Mr. Rosen, “Be More Chill” features a theremin, which does its electronic ooo-oo-ooo thing when a mind-controlling super computer dies. There is also a flugelbone, which he described as his “orchestrating secret weapon”: It’s a horn that can be managed by a trumpet player but can sound sort of like a French horn or a trombone, which allows one musician to produce a variety of timbres for a small orchestra.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Joe Iconis, who wrote the music and lyrics for “Be More Chill,” said Mr. Rosen’s ability to have so many instruments in his head, but also so many different kinds of music, both old and new, can give his work an air of “magic.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “His breadth of knowledge of music of all types is just intimidating,” Mr. Iconis said. “As much as he knows the synth sound that was used on the latest Ariana Grande record, he knows the model of trombone used in orchestration for ‘How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying.’”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. Rosen has lots of plans — he’d like to write music for video games, score a film, be commissioned by a major symphony orchestra to write a piece — but no particular endgame in mind, he said. He just wants to keep going.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “You don’t get to be Charlie without being insanely ambitious,” said Jason Robert Brown, who was the composer and lyricist for “13” and has worked with Mr. Rosen on several concerts and shows since. “But I think it’s really an ambition to have as much music in his life and in his head and in his mouth as he possibly can. He just loves making music.”

</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The United Nations-backed government of Libya sought on Saturday to reassure its Western supporters by distancing itself from terrorists and extremists.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Some fighters with extremist ties or who have been targeted by United Nations sanctions have said this week that they were joining the Libyan government’s fight against an attack by a militia leader.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The militia leader,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/12/world/middleeast/libya-hifter-benghazi.html?module=inline" title="">
  Gen. Khalifa Hifter
 </a>
 , 75, has long portrayed himself as commanding a fight against terrorism as he has tried to establish himself as a new military ruler of Libya. He has promised an end to the mayhem of warring factions and fiefdoms that has followed the ouster of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi during the Arab Spring uprising of 2011.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But his critics say his often indiscriminate attacks have only ended up driving more mainstream opponents into alliances of desperation with militants and extremists.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 That debate has now taken on new urgency because over the last nine days, General Hifter, who loosely controls much of eastern Libya,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/world/africa/libya-tripoli-militia-hifter.html?module=inline" title="">
  has begun a new attempt to take over
 </a>
 the headquarters of the United Nations-backed government in the capital, Tripoli.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The government said Saturday it “strongly denies the allegations that among our ranks there are fighters who belong to terrorist organizations.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Its main defenders have been powerful militias based in the nearby cities of Zintan and Misrata that led the fight to oust Colonel Qaddafi and are not considered extremists. Militias from Misrata had previously played the leading role in defeating the militants of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, after they had established a Libyan base.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But several fighters with extremist ties or under United Nations sanctions have also said they are joining the battle against General Hifter.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Among them is the warlord Salah Badi, who has previously allied with Islamist extremists and who is under United Nations sanctions for undermining stability. Also joining the fray is Brigade Defend Benghazi, which largely absorbed an earlier coalition that included a militia under United Nations sanctions as a terrorist organization.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The militia it included was Ansar al-Shariah, whose fighters played a major role in the attack on a United States diplomatic compound that killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens in 2012.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ziad Bellam, a brigade leader who also fought against General Hifter in Benghazi, said in an online video last week that he was returning to the battle in Tripoli to avenge a deceased leader of Ansar al-Shariah and other comrades considered extremists.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Western governments have almost universally condemned General Hifter’s advance on the capital, which upended United Nations efforts to negotiate a solution to the Libyan fighting.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But the European Union said Thursday that its members “express their concern at the involvement of terrorist and criminal elements in the fighting, including individuals listed by the U.N. Security Council.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The New York Times also
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/12/world/africa/tripoli-libya-hifter.html?module=inline" title="">
  reported on Friday
 </a>
 about extremists and others under United Nations sanctions rushing into the fight against General Hifter.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In an apparent response to that report and the European Union, the government in Tripoli said Saturday that it “was and still is fighting terrorism and hunting down its remnants.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The government argued on Saturday that it was General Hifter’s attack that had “opened the road to the reactivation of the terrorist sleeper cells that are waiting for the opportunity.”

</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Liverpool didn't slip up this time.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 A 2-0 win over Chelsea — sealed by a stunning long-range goal by Mohamed Salah — preserved Liverpool's two-point lead in the Premier League over Manchester City, which beat Crystal Palace 3-1 earlier Sunday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The victory also meant the Reds partially avenged a memorable 2-0 loss to Chelsea at Anfield near the end of the 2013-14 season that ultimately cost them the title. That defeat was sparked by a slip by Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard that let in Demba Ba to score the first goal, and Chelsea's visiting fans reminded the home supporters about that moment throughout the game on Sunday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We knew that everything was going to be different today," Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Liverpool's goals came in a 142-second spell at the start of the second half. Sadio Mane's header put the home team ahead in the 51st, before Salah cut in from the right and arrowed in a 25-yard (meter) shot into the far corner.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 City, which has a game in hand over Liverpool, had put the pressure on with a dominant display at Selhurst Park against a team that has caused the champions problems in recent meetings.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Raheem Sterling recovered from a glaring early miss to score twice and put City 2-0 ahead, Luka Milivojevic responded for Palace in the 81st, before Gabriel Jesus sealed a ninth straight league win for City with a 90th-minute goal.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 City has the harder run-in, with games still to come against Tottenham and Manchester United, but will retain the title with five straight victories to close the season.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "The Premier League position is in our hands," City manager Pep Guardiola said, "and we want to win all the games."
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Liverpool's remaining matches are against Cardiff, Huddersfield, Newcastle and Wolverhampton Wanderers.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "We expect them to win all their games so we just need to get as many points as possible," Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp said, "and if we're champions then great, but if not, it is still a really good football team."
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 THE YOGA MAN
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Salah won the FIFA Puskas Award for the goal of the 2017-18 season, courtesy of his solo strike in the Merseyside derby at Anfield.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He might end up keeping the title.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 With one of the great goals seen at Anfield, Salah received Van Dijk's long ball from the back, cut inside off the right wing, and sent a diagonal shot into the top corner from 25 yards (meters). He celebrated in front of The Kop by standing on one foot in a yoga pose.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "I'm a yoga man," Salah said with a smile.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Klopp described the goal as "world class" because of "the control, the first touch, going inside, the movement to give him a little bit of space, and then I was 100% convinced ... a fantastic goal."
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Chelsea had its chances at 2-0 down, with Eden Hazard hitting the post and then mis-hitting a shot from close range straight at goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Maurizio Sarri's team stayed in fourth place in a tight race for a top-four finish and Champions League qualification, but could get overtaken if Arsenal beats Watford on Monday.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 City has remained in title contention despite its best player last season — Kevin De Bruyne — missing much of the last eight months because of three separate injuries.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Belgium midfielder is back to full fitness and one pass against Palace highlighted the impact he can have on City for the run-in.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 His perfectly weighted through-ball sent in Sterling for the opening goal in the 15th minute, and drew praise from Guardiola.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "He has the ability and vision to see passes that other human beings are not able to watch," Guardiola said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 De Bruyne finished the game with two assists after setting up Jesus for the third goal after a surging forward run on a counterattack. They were his first assists of his injury-plagued season, after making 16 in the 2017-18 campaign.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The game came in the middle of a two-legged Champions League quarterfinal against Tottenham, which won the first match 1-0. City plays Tottenham next in the league, too, on Saturday.

 NEW DELHI — Young Indians could play a crucial role in the ongoing general election in the world's largest democracy.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 With nearly two-thirds of India's population below 35, and more than 15 million first-time voters aged 18 and 19, young men and women have the power to swing the national vote in any direction.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ambitious, aspirational and impatient for change, young voters — at least in India's capital — are less focused on issues such as caste and religion than older generations, according to interviews with The Associated Press.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 They are interested, instead, on landing jobs after college, living in cleaner cities with breathable air, increasing women's safety and competing with the world's biggest economies.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Current Prime Minister Narendra Modi seems to be the favorite, riding a wave of Hindu nationalism that peaked after India's air force attacked an alleged militant base in Pakistan to avenge a suicide attack that killed more than 40 soldiers in disputed Kashmir.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 His main opponent, Congress party's Rahul Gandhi, hopes to revive the glory of India's grand old party that ruled the country for more than 50 years, since independence from British colonial rule in 1947.

 KABUL, Afghanistan — A brother’s sandals. A flag of Afghanistan. A daughter’s favorite toy.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 These are some of the remnants of lives lost to violence.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The prosaic belongings, collected in handmade wooden containers, are displayed in the frigid basement of a house in Kabul. They are the possessions of the dead, lovingly preserved by family members of Afghans killed during the past 40 years of conflict.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 An exhibition of these everyday items — from scarves and robes to teacups and poems — seeks to memorialize a tiny fraction of the hundreds of thousands of civilians who have died violently since 1979 in Afghanistan, a country that rarely pauses to remember its victims.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Each so-called memory box includes a narrative composed by loved ones about the life lost, making each tragedy personal.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “We want the story written by the victims themselves,” said Hadi Marifat, director of the Afghanistan Center for Memory and Dialogue, where the exhibition, which opened in February, is housed.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Countless Afghan families have been shattered by violence, but the civilian dead are often forgotten and forsaken by everyone but their closest relatives, even as combatants — warlords, commanders, fighters — are lionized as martyrs in billboards and posters.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 An exhibition label suggested these civilian victims have endured a “double catastrophe” — a violent death, followed by public erasure.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 For victims’ families, the memory boxes are expressions of both grief and healing.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 One of the 36 boxes on display belongs to Kabal Shah, whose brother was killed by a suicide bomber in 2016. The ambulance driver who delivered the body to Mr. Shah asked for the new sneakers the dead man wore that day. In his grief, Mr. Shah obliged.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He regretted that decision when he was first asked to build a memory box. But he had saved his brother’s favorite sandals, and that proved good enough.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “I wanted to make sure that my brother’s memory is preserved,” Mr. Shah said. “I want people to see what happened to my country — who we have lost and how painful it is.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Another box contained a letter smuggled from prison in 1979 inside a hollow toothpaste tube, written in tiny script on cigarette pack paper: “I am still alive.” The prisoner who wrote it, Dawood Sharif, was executed a month later.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 A pink toy dressing table cherished by an 8-year-old girl, Saima, was inside another box. She was killed by a suicide bomber in Kabul in 2015. Her father, Mohammad Musa, wrote of his efforts to locate her remains.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 A nearby box featured a shirt and belt that belonged to Hikmatullah, 28, and Asadullah, 15, brothers killed in 2016 by a suicide bomber at a social justice rally in Kabul. Their mother, Maryam Shafayee, wrote that she had begged her sons not to attend, but gave them a bag of dried fruit to sustain them.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 She received the bag, unopened, after her sons’ bodies were recovered.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “I always wish I had been killed with them,” Ms. Shafayee wrote.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The memory boxes are displayed in glass cases in an unheated, subterranean expanse under harsh lights, subjecting visitors to physical discomfort as they read family members’ heartbreaking accounts. Above the displays are photographs of the dead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 A written timeline snakes across whitewashed walls — a chronicle of misery that catalogs four distinct eras of violence, from the Soviet invasion in 1979, through the civil wars that followed, to the grinding coalition war against the Taliban, now in its 18th year.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Embedded in the timeline are the names of 8,450 people who lost their lives to suicide bombers, assassins, weapons of war and unknown gunmen. That figure is a small fraction of the total victims of violence spanning 40 years.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Over the past decade alone, 32,000
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/24/world/asia/afghanistan-civilian-casualties.html?module=inline" title="">
  Afghan civilians have died
 </a>
 , according to the United Nations.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The nameless victims of mass killings are also commemorated at the exhibition. A map of Afghanistan shaped from dried mud and clay is dotted with tiny pins representing 19 confirmed mass graves — red flags for those from the communist era and black for the mujahedeen and Taliban periods.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In the exhibition, there is also a tower built from scorched robes, scarves, shoes and backpacks — residue recovered from several bomb attacks that indiscriminately targeted civilians.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “You can still smell the dried blood,” said Fatima Alavy, who works at the center.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The center received funding from the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission. Sima Samar, the director of the commission and a medical doctor, has her own story of violence to tell.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 She said her husband, Abdul Ghafoor Sultani, was kidnapped in 1979 by agents of the Soviet-backed government at the time. She never saw him again.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The couple’s son vowed at age 5 to avenge his father’s death, Dr. Samar said. The boy cut the eyes out of newspaper photographs of government officials he blamed for his father’s kidnapping.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Her adult son no longer seeks vengeance, Dr. Samar said. But she said she feared the country would never recover as long as Afghans seek conflict and retribution rather than healing and reconciliation.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Everyone is so focused on fighting and trying to stay safe that the victims are ignored,” Dr. Samar said. “They deserve respect and acknowledgment for their suffering.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Inside the exhibition room, Nilofar Bayat, 26, described the rocket attack that struck her home in 1994, killing her brother, Assad Bayat, 13, and leaving her at age 2 with permanent spinal cord damage.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Most of her brother’s possessions were damaged, she said, but she recovered his school notebook for her memory box.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “I want people to see the person I lost — to know who he was,” Ms. Bayat said. “I have never forgotten what happened. I don’t want anyone else to forget, either.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 A few feet way, Sima Dawlatshahi, 65, spoke of her husband and son, killed 32 years apart. Her husband, Mohammad Yunos, was kidnapped in 1984 and never seen again. Ms. Dawlatshahi said she was pregnant at the time with the couple’s son, Ahmad Sharif.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 2016, Ahmad died at 32 in a suicide bombing. His wife was pregnant with the couple’s daughter, Ms. Dawlatshahi said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 She sobbed as she described selecting possessions for her memory box. Soon those listening to her were weeping, too.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Through her tears, Ms. Dawlatshahi spoke of the lasting legacy of her husband and son, now enshrined in her memory box, which includes her husband’s favorite books and her son’s birth certificate.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “If people see this box and know of their goodness, my heart will be at peace,” she said.

 BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. — Conan O’Brien fell under the spell of the historian and biographer Robert A. Caro when he was a student at Harvard in the 1980s. The book that made him a fan was “The Path to Power,” the first installment of the multivolume epic “The Years of Lyndon Johnson.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. O’Brien devoured the second, third and fourth volumes of the still-growing series, and across his 26 years as a talk-show host, he put in numerous requests to interview the Pulitzer Prize winner. Mr. Caro found time over the years to appear on shows hosted by Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, but he always said no to Mr. O’Brien.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 On Tuesday, there was a happy resolution.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “I’m anxious,” Mr. O’Brien said as he rode in a black S.U.V. from the Warner Bros. Studio in Burbank, where he tapes his TBS show, to Temple Emanuel in Beverly Hills, where he would interview Mr. Caro. “It’s very unusual to meet somebody whose work you’re so familiar with.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/24/style/conan-obrien-robert-caro.html?module=inline" title="">
  an interview
 </a>
 with The New York Times last year, Mr. O’Brien said, “The Lyndon Johnson books by Caro, it’s our Harry Potter,” and described in detail his many thwarted attempts to sit down with Mr. Caro. The author finally caved on the occasion of his tour for
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/books/review/robert-a-caro-working.html?module=inline" title="">
  “Working,”
 </a>
 his new, relatively slim book on his writing and research methods.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 At 83, Mr. Caro is enjoying a moment of appreciation, and he has made appearances in recent days in Austin, Tex., Philadelphia and New York, his home city. Mr. O’Brien, 55, acknowledged that he had not exactly landed an exclusive.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “People keep saying, ‘I heard him on this podcast,’” he said. “‘He dropped in at Coachella.’ ‘He opened a mall in Paramus.’”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The S.U.V. turned onto North La Cienega Boulevard. Mr. O’Brien pointed at a building.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “That’s where I got started in this business,” he said. “The Coronet Theatre. I took improv classes there with a talented young person named Lisa Kudrow. If you had told me then that 33 years from now I’d be in a car with a writer from The New York Times on my way to interview Robert Caro, I would have said, ‘That sounds about right.’”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In the rabbi’s study at Temple Emanuel, he didn’t have to wait long for Mr. Caro.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “They probably told you,” Mr. O’Brien said, “I’m a fan to a disturbing level.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “I want to say, if I’ve ever been asked to be on your show, my publisher never told me,” Mr. Caro replied.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “I like this way better,” Mr. O’Brien said. “I respect you too much to have you on my show.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 After a handshake that lasted 30 seconds, they sat at a conference table. Then something strange occurred. Mr. Caro effectively started interviewing Mr. O’Brien. What was his thesis at Harvard? After Mr. O’Brien said it was on the works of Flannery O’Connor and William Faulkner, Mr. Caro asked him if he had ever spent time in the South and followed up by asking the host what he thought of the region’s relationship to the larger United States.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Wow, I love that you’re asking my opinion on anything,” Mr. O’Brien said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The conversation tilted toward President Trump.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “You don’t know if this is an aberration or not, if Trump is something outside, and he’s going to lose, and we’ll forget,” Mr. Caro said. “Or, is he the first of the mad Roman emperors?”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 They briefly went over Mr. Caro’s appearance on Mr. O’Brien’s new
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.earwolf.com/show/conan-obrien/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  podcast
 </a>
 , “Conan O’Brien Needs a Friend,” which was scheduled for the next day. “We have a very young audience,” Mr. O’Brien said. “I want them to hear about work ethic.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was almost 7:30. Show time.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 They stepped out of the study and into a standing ovation from the 550 people who had paid $20 for general admission or $38 for a seat and a copy of “Working.” Mr. O’Brien called the event, which had been organized by Writers Bloc, a nonprofit literary series in Los Angeles, the “thrill of a lifetime.” He added, “I also want to thank you, Mr. Caro, for finally writing a book that’ll fit on my night table.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. O’Brien gave a shout-out to Mr. Caro’s wife and longtime working partner, the historian
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://books.wwnorton.com/books/Author.aspx?id=20571" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Ina Caro
 </a>
 , who was seated in the front row. He noted the dedication she displayed in agreeing to move with her husband to the Texas Hill Country, where President Johnson was raised, back when Mr. Caro was looking for insights into his subject’s early years.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. O’Brien added that his wife, Liza Powel O’Brien, who was also in attendance, wouldn’t have gone along with such a thing; but Ms. Caro, he said, was completely on board.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Not exactly,” Ms. Caro whispered to the person seated next to her.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. O’Brien and Mr. Caro dug into Lyndon Johnson’s life. His father. His mistress. His ambition. They also talked at length about Mr. Caro’s writing process. As the discussion went on, Mr. O’Brien found himself far from the talk show format. Mr. Caro spoke the way he writes, answering questions in shapely monologues that lasted five or six minutes.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 An hour in, Mr. O’Brien asked the author how he felt about the Horace Mann School, his high school alma mater in the Bronx, having named a prize after him.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “No one has ever asked me that,” Mr. Caro said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “I’ve been waiting a long time,” Mr. O’Brien replied.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The host then asked Mr. Caro if he agreed with Ernest Hemingway’s comment that a writer should not “exhaust the fuel tank in one writing session,” so that it’s easier to start again the next day.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Yes, and you’re the first person that ever mentioned that,” Mr. Caro said, before noting that he had written his thesis at Princeton on Mr. Hemingway.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Why am I in comedy?” Mr. O’Brien said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Did Mr. Caro ever take breaks? Sneak away from his desk to an afternoon movie?
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “See the new ‘Avengers,’” Mr. O’Brien suggested. “Ina doesn’t have to know about it.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Never in my entire life,” Mr. Caro replied.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. O’Brien proposed coming by Mr. Caro’s office one day and taking him to a matinee.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “If I don’t answer,” Mr. Caro said, “it’s because I’m so deep in the work.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 After a Q. and A. session and another round of applause, Mr. Caro seemed pleased. “I thought these questions tonight were exceptional,” he said in a side room. “Incisive.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 To think, the event had almost been scuttled.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 On Tuesday morning, Mr. Caro’s flight from Austin to Los Angeles was canceled. Mr. Caro said he immediately thought of Mr. O’Brien. “That was in my mind,” he said. “I said, ‘He’s never going to believe it, if I said the flight got canceled.’”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 His publishing house, Knopf, had to make a decision: pull out of the interview, or find a way to make it happen. The publisher quickly booked a charter flight — Mr. Caro described it as an eight-seater jet — to Van Nuys Airport.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “The downside of canceling the event was disappointing Mr. Caro’s legion of admirers,” said Paul Bogaards, a spokesman at Knopf. “Additionally, the prospect of sending Conan into an irrevocable tailspin did not sit well with me. God knows, he’s waited long enough for this to happen.”
