 One thing we learn in “Captain Marvel” is that it’s pronounced MarVELL, like the English poet — or at least it used to be, on distant planets and right here on Earth, a windy rock also known as C-53. That was back in 1995, when most of this movie takes place and when the world as we know it had not yet been colonized by the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Yes, of course, Marvel Comics had been around for decades, but when the heroine crashes through the roof of the Blockbuster Video store, landing in between the “Family” and “Drama” sections, there are no Avengers or Iron-Man titles on the shelves.

 Instead, she picks up a VHS box of
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/21/movies/film-right-stuff-on-astronauts.html?module=inline" title="">
  “The Right Stuff,”
 </a>
 which earns a mild chuckle, since while we know that she’s a space alien named Vers (rhymes with “cheers”), we also have reason to suspect that this young woman is connected with the United States Air Force, and maybe the space program, too, like the guys in that film. Also known as Carol Danvers, and played by Brie Larson, she has some of their bravado, and also — since she’s on the way to intergalactic superheroism — a righteous sense of mission and a burgeoning identity crisis.

 The last and least surprising thing we learn about her is that “Captain Marvel will return in ‘Avengers: Endgame,’” a scrappy little picture that will be released in seven weeks, if you can stand to wait that long. Directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck from a script they wrote with Geneva Robertson-Dworet, “Captain Marvel” is an origin story, which is to say a résumé check for the newest member of popular culture’s biggest, most heavily capitalized corporate team.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 As such, it’s pretty good fun, and could almost be described without sarcasm as a scrappy little picture, like most of Boden and Fleck’s other work. (

</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And of course Samuel L. Jackson, who plays a young, two-eyed S.H.I.E.L.D. agent named Nicholas Fury. How Fury lost one of those eyes is the big spoiler to avoid here, and the character’s extended presence, after so many agitated cameos over the years, is a big part of the movie’s appeal. To watch the digitally rejuvenated Jackson riding around mid-90s Los Angeles, sort of like he did in “Pulp Fiction,” is to indulge in a bit of Gen-X nostalgia, a mood augmented by period-appropriate musical cues from Salt-N-Pepa, TLC and Nirvana.

 There are pay phones and pagers, too, and boxy government cars and all kinds of stuff that kids these days just don’t appreciate. Even the science-fiction elements have a mildly retro, “Star Trek: The Next Generation” feel. And the overall vibe, for all the fireballs and fisticuffs, is decidedly friendly. In addition to the Vers/Fury buddy-movie pairing, there is a best friend for Carol (a fellow pilot named Maria Rambeau, played by Lashana Lynch) and a succession of frenemies. Best of all, there is an orange cat.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The plot of “Captain Marvel,” for some reason, is another secret I’m supposed to keep. Which is fine. In spite of what some unhinged fans on social media might say, I was not paid by Disney to explain anything. Boden and Fleck were, and they do a perfectly adequate job. There’s a big war going on between the Kree — Vers’s people, at least as far as she knows — and the Skrull, green-skinned, pointy-eared beings who have the unnerving skill of turning into doppelgängers of anyone they see. Annette Bening is involved. We first see her as a manifestation of Supreme Intelligence, which seems accurate enough. I’ll say no more.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The twists in the story reveal a slyly anti-imperialist politics, which is both in keeping with the pluralist ethic of the Avengers cycle and just a bit subversive of the Disney-Marvel agenda of universal domination. The most sympathetic group of characters wants nothing more than to go somewhere else, to escape from the annihilating attention of their would-be conquerors. They might represent various oppressed and dispossessed earthly populations. They might also stand in for that portion of the movie audience that feels the cinematic universe shrinking around them.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Not that anyone can stop the Marvel Cinematic Universe from expanding. By now the contradictions of this gigantic enterprise are obvious enough. It’s inclusive and monopolistic, predatory and empowering. Every episode is unique — every hero is a complex individual with a singular back story — within an overall structure of sameness.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Filmmakers like Boden and Fleck, Ryan Coogler and Taika Waititi can put their own spin on a given story or hero, but at some point bolts or waves of orange or blue light will come shooting out of someone’s hands and someone else will be thrown backward and bounce off a wall. The protagonist’s costume will become a character in its own right. That protagonist — a tough and charming woman, in this case, determined to fight gender clichés at least to a draw — will be ready for a career of franchise clock-punching, along with the rest of us. You will stay through the very last credits in the hope of collecting every last Easter egg, and you’ll shuffle out of the theater feeling both satisfied and empty.

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name

 , an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mar-Vell
 </a>
 started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1967,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Carol Danvers
 </a>
 was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Introduced in 1982,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Rambeau_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Monica Rambeau
 </a>
 worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed

 has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When her series began in 2014,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala_Khan_(Earth-616)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Kamala Khan
 </a>
 was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,”

 As “Captain Marvel” swooped into its second weekend in theaters on Friday, the question wasn’t really whether it would top domestic ticket sales, but by how much.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Disney-Marvel can breathe easy. Their latest superhero origin story, the
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/movies/captain-marvel.html?module=inline" title="">
  first film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe dedicated to a female superhero
 </a>
 , sold an estimated $69.3 million in tickets nationwide this weekend, bringing its North American total to around $266.2 million.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 That’s a higher figure than the lifetime domestic gross of “Captain America: The Winter Soldier” ($259.8 million), and already makes “Captain Marvel” the 13th-best-selling film in the current 21-movie Marvel series — with room to grow.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Captain Marvel” has done well internationally, too, with $120 million in overseas sales this weekend, according to the studio, for a global total of $760 million. While the figures aren’t earth-shattering, they indicate a solid success for Disney-Marvel.

 That success came despite attempts by trolls to derail “Captain Marvel.” Ahead of its release, the film was the target of efforts at online sabotage by users apparently lashing out against its star, Brie Larson, who has been outspoken in her support of more diverse representation in Hollywood movies. The campaign
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/movies/captain-marvel-brie-larson-rotten-tomatoes.html?module=inline" title="">
  prompted the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes to make major changes to its longstanding rules,
 </a>
 including the elimination of audience reviews for movies that have not yet been released.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Free from any targeted online attack was Paramount’s “Wonder Park,” an animated family movie about a young girl who
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/movies/wonder-park-amusement-parks.html?module=inline" title="">

 </a>
 and sees them colorfully brought to life. That movie sold $16 million in tickets domestically this weekend, according to Comscore, which compiles box-office data. While a far cry from “Captain Marvel,” the figure was more than enough to land “Wonder Park” in second place.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The only other newcomer in the top five was Lionsgate and CBS Films’s “Five Feet Apart,” in third. The movie, about a couple whose shared genetic disorder forces them to maintain physical distance from each other despite their growing romance, sold $13.2 million in tickets.
</p><p class="css-1e7dx92 evys1bk0">
 An earlier version of this article omitted the name of a distributor of “Five Feet Apart.” The movie is distributed by Lionsgate and CBS Films, not just Lionsgate.

 Those who appeared to have targeted “Captain Marvel” were most likely incited by comments made by Brie Larson, the titular star. Last year, Larson vowed to seek out more underrepresented journalists after noticing she was being interviewed by mostly white men. She had a similar critique about film critics: “I do not need a 40-year-old white dude to tell me what didn’t work for him about ‘A Wrinkle in Time.’ It wasn’t made for him.”

 "Objectification is obvious with costumes like Leia's gold bikini or Padmé’s black leather corset dress,” said Mary C. King, one of the researchers. But it was the many subtle ways that characters’ looks were altered — more color, softer hairstyles — that she said surprised researchers the most.

 In her top hat and tuxedo, Gladys Bentley belted gender-bending original blues numbers and lewd parodies of popular songs, eventually becoming 1920s Harlem royalty. When not accompanied by a dazzling piano, the singer often swept through the audience, flirting with women and soliciting dirty lyrics from them as she sang.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 By the early 1930s, Bentley was Harlem’s most famous lesbian figure and among the best-known black entertainers in the U.S. She was also the first prominent performer of her era to embrace a transgender identity.

 If movie studios needed another reminder that audiences are craving for new kinds of superpowered heroes, they got it this weekend.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Disney’s “Captain Marvel” rode a wave of enthusiasm for more diverse superheroes, a hunger for blockbusters at a quiet time of year and a large helping of ’90s nostalgia to sell $153 million in tickets in U.S. theaters over the weekend.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was easily the best stateside debut weekend of any movie this year as it breezily outperformed expectations and brought the domestic box office a much-needed boost.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Brie Larson-led movie’s opening weekend was the seventh best of any in the 21-film Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise, behind the $174.1 million brought in by “Iron Man 3” and just ahead of “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,” which made $146.5 million during its first weekend. (Topping that list: “Avengers: Infinity War,” which took in $257.7 million when it debuted.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Captain Marvel” is the
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/movies/captain-marvel.html?module=inline" title="">
  first film in the franchise dedicated to the story of a female superhero
 </a>
 . DC-Warner Bros. and their Gal Gadot-led
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/31/movies/wonder-woman-review-gal-gadot.html?module=inline" title="">
  “Wonder Woman”

  broke a comic book glass ceiling
 </a>
 in 2017, but “Captain Marvel” had an even stronger opening, bringing in over $50 million more than “Wonder Woman,”
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/04/movies/wonder-woman-deflects-doubt-to-win-battle-at-the-box-office.html?module=inline" title="">
  which sold around $100.5 million in tickets
 </a>
 during its opening weekend. While DC-Warner Bros. hired a single woman — Patty Jenkins — to direct “Wonder Woman,” Disney-Marvel’s movie split directing duties between Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, who wrote the script with Geneva Robertson-Dworet.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 An origin story whose soundtrack trades in the likes of Salt-N-Pepa and Nirvana, “Captain Marvel” is set principally in 1990s California, where Larson’s hero crash-lands and eventually teams up with Nicholas Fury, a government agent familiar to Marvel fans and here played by a younger-looking, digitally rejuvenated Samuel L. Jackson. Ben Mendelsohn, Jude Law, Annette Bening and Lashana Lynch play other major roles.

 “Captain Marvel” received fairly positive reviews —
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/captain_marvel" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  it currently holds an 80% “fresh” rating on Rotten Tomatoes
 </a>
 — but its critical reception hasn’t been as strong as some other high-grossing Disney-Marvel entries (by comparison, “The Avengers” holds a
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/marvels_the_avengers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  92% “fresh” rating

 ; “Captain America: Civil War”
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/captain_america_civil_war" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  holds 91%
 </a>
 ). Whether the critics’ responses affect the new movie’s staying power remains to be seen, but its strong start is good news for Disney. The studio is also using “Captain Marvel” to drive up interest in “Avengers: Endgame,” the next entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that’s slated for release next month. That film will count Brie Larson’s newly-minted character among its ensemble of heroes, alongside Chris Evans’s Captain America, Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man, Mark Ruffalo’s Hulk, Chadwick Boseman’s Black Panther and others in what is essentially the popcorn movie equivalent of a musical supergroup.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Moviegoers who didn’t see “Captain Marvel” this weekend mostly picked between two other films. Universal’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/movies/how-to-train-your-dragon-hidden-world-review.html?module=inline" title="">
  “How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,”

 now in its third weekend, brought in about $14.7 million. And Lionsgate’s

 opens, S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) calls heroes “an old-fashioned notion.” But it’s one that still sells, as we’re reminded in this two-and-a-half-minute clip summarizing the 21 films that have led up to this installment.

</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The trailer brings back memories, some more vivid than others. Remember when the

 </a>
 ”? That was weird.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Breaking chronological order, the spot culminates with “Avengers: Infinity War” (which came out before “Ant-Man and the Wasp” and “Captain Marvel”). In it, Thanos (

 “Avengers: Endgame” will officially hit theaters on April 26.

 PRINCETON, N.J. — On the evening of March 19, the mathematician Karen Uhlenbeck gathered with revelers at the Institute for Advanced Study for a champagne reception. Some hours earlier she’d been awarded the Abel Prize — the first time a woman had won it — for her discovery of a phenomenon called “bubbling,” among other effervescent results.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dr. Uhlenbeck is a professor emerita at the University of Texas at Austin, where she spent the better part of her career (having declined a professorship at Harvard). She retired in 2014 and moved to Princeton. At the institute, she keeps a desk piled with boxes of books. She describes herself as a messy reader, and a messy thinker, and she is stylishly disheveled, with a preference for comfy, colorful clothing with pockets and Birkenstocks with socks.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 As a procession of speeches and toasts lauded her life’s work, Dr. Uhlenbeck stood to the side of the lectern and listened, eyes mostly closed. When it finally came time to make her own remarks (unprepared), she began by simply agreeing: “From the perspective of my late seventies, I find myself as a young mathematician sort of impressive, too.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 She went on to note that, for lack of mathematical candidates, her role model had been the chef Julia Child. “She knew how to pick the turkey up off the floor and serve it,” Dr. Uhlenbeck said.

 Jo Nelson, a mathematician at Rice University and a friend of Dr. Uhlenbeck, was thrilled that her visit to the institute coincided with a celebration for one of her mentors. “It’s amazing to hear a woman’s mathematical achievements celebrated and discussed in such detail,” she said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Even Robert MacPherson, a topologist and faculty member in mathematics at the institute, made a rare social appearance. “This is wonderful in so many ways,” he said, holding a mini

 of brut rosé bubbles.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">

 describing how, in three and higher dimensions, individual bubbles evolve in live foams — the fleeting foam at the meniscus in his champagne flute, for instance, or the more enduring head on a pint of beer.

 Researchers of all stripes have written
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://pages.jh.edu/~aprospe1/publications/PapersPublished/General/Bubbles_PhysFluids.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  “many thousands of papers” on bubbles

 , Andrea Prosperetti, a mechanical engineer at the University of Houston, has estimated. Bubbles entice for their seeming simplicity, which approaches the existential.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Bubbles are emptiness, non-liquid, a tiny cloud shielding a mathematical singularity,” he wrote. “Born from chance, a violent and brief life ending in the union with the nearly infinite.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And bubbles are everywhere, on every scale, once you start looking: high-tech drug-delivery mechanisms, emulsified salad dressings, soapsuds, black holes and beyond. In architecture, the

  the Weaire-Phelan foam
 </a>
 , the most efficiently packed foam of equal-volume polyhedral bubbles, discovered in 1994 by Irish physicist Denis Weaire and his student Robert Phelan (first using a computer simulation, then

</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dr. Uhlenbeck’s contribution is less practical. The Abel Prize cited “her pioneering achievements in geometric partial differential equations, gauge theory and integrable systems, and for the fundamental impact of her work on analysis, geometry and mathematical physics.” The whimsical name for her work — “bubbling” — belies its prickly technicalities.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “It’s much more abstract and theoretical, and metaphorical,” Dr. Uhlenbeck said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The definitive piece of literature on bubbles and soap films — a film is the wall of a bubble, and a bubble is one cell in a foam — is “
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://facstaff.susqu.edu/brakke/aux/downloads/plateau-eng.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Experimental and Theoretical Statistics of Liquids Subject to Molecular Forces Only
 </a>
 ,” published in 1873 by Belgian physicist Joseph Plateau.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He experimented with soap bubbles for decades, capturing their behavior in what are now called Plateau’s laws. In a
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.abebooks.com/Plateau-Soap-Bubbles-REVIEW-Plateaus-Statique/19780610531/bd" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  review of the book in Nature
 </a>
 , Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell lamented, “Can the poetry of bubbles survive this?”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 A soap bubble is the physical world’s solution for a mathematical challenge: to minimize a surface area — in this case, one that surrounds a prescribed volume of air. Nature is always seeking to optimize, to maximize gain at minimal cost in energy cost. So “minimal surfaces” problems are all around, even in higher dimensions, and all kinds of researchers are working to describe the governing rules.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “It is a timeless subject,” said Dr. Uhlenbeck, at her dining room table. On the afternoon of prize day, she had been hiding out at her house, conserving her strength for the party. A founder of a field called geometric analysis, Dr. Uhlenbeck approaches minimal surfaces esoterically, under the banner of “variational methods in geometry.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “I’ll give you a problem,” she said. “Take a fixed length of string, lie it down on the plane”— such as a table — “and enclose the largest area you can inside. I wobble the string a little bit, I vary it just a little, to see whether the area increases or decreases.” The optimal answer is not a square but a circle. You might try a square, she said: “But by unkinking and smoothing out the corners, you
 <!-- -->
 can enclose more area.
 <!-- -->
 That’s a variational process.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In a classic paper from 1976, Cyril Isenberg declared the soap film “
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/27847462.pdf?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  an analogue computer.”
 </a>
 <!-- -->
 He used wire frames of polyhedra, such as a tetrahedron or cube, and dipped them in a soapsuds solution in order to compute — faster than a mathematician, certainly — the solution to those particular three-dimensional minimization problems
 <!-- -->
 .
 <!-- -->
 (Minimization problems are even important these days in deep learning. “The techniques involve minimizing lots and lots and lots of small problems all over the place,” Dr. Uhlenbeck said.)
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This method was popularized in the 1940s by Richard Courant, the founding director of the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University. Recently, Courant researchers in the applied mathematics lab conducted
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://math.nyu.edu/faculty/shelley/papers/GOSR2018.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  a study
 </a>
 that concluded that “there is more than one way to blow a bubble.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Their experiment involved blowing large bubbles of olive oil (Bertolli) in a water tunnel, creating what investigators called “a mathematical river.” This led to a “master formula” describing the critical flow speed needed to blow and pinch off a bubble.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But they also discovered another way to blow a bubble: impose a gentle flow, below the critical speed, on a film that is already somewhat inflated.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “We found this second result surprising,” said Leif Ristroph, one of the study’s authors. “This might explain how we often blow bubbles as kids. A quick puff bends the film outward, and thereafter the film still inflates even as the flow of air slows.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Last December came news of another bubbling lab creation, this time involving ordinary dishwashing solution and inspired by the scutoid, a
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05376-1#Abs1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  new geometric shape
 </a>
 discovered last year in a study of tissue cells. “We took up the matter because we had always been interested in the close resemblance of some biological cell systems to soap froths,” said Dr. Weaire.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 A scutoid has been compared to a twisted prism — an odd shape for a living cell, but sometimes an optimal one when tissues are growing, curving and developing. Dr. Weaire wondered: Is the scutoid’s optimization imposed by genetics, or merely geometry and the physics of the moment? Is it “simply attributable to the bare bones of the theory of bubbles, that is, just the elementary laws of surface tension, as laid down by Plateau? For this purpose, are cells just bubbles?”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The bubbles answered in the affirmative. The experiment successfully produced “
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09500839.2018.1552806" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  scutoid configurations in a dry foam sandwich
 </a>
 ” (with a computer simulation to match, embodying only the surface tension forces in a foam).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Theorists also contemplate bubbles at the larger end of the scale spectrum. At the University of Cambridge, Adriana Pesci and other applied mathematicians study soap films that form on the frame of a Möbius strip. “The interesting thing about
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://journals.aps.org/prfluids/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevFluids.1.060503" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  this investigation
 </a>
 is that
 <!-- -->
 it all started with solar flares,” Dr. Pesci said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Astrophysicists have long postulated, if only symbolically, that
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://adsbit.harvard.edu/full/1986ApJ...302L...1D/L000001.000.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  galaxy clusters have a soapsuds structure
 </a>
 . Minimal surfaces also are important in studying black holes, their dynamics driven by a “

 .”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Over the 2018-2019 academic year, researchers from around the world gathered at the Institute for Advanced Study for one of its annual thematic deep dives — a “

 ,” devoted to minimal surfaces and related tributaries. “It’s the world’s biggest bubble fest around here lately,” said Helmut Hofer, an institute mathematician.

 </a>
 were cited often in the seminars and workshops. Hiding out at home on prize day, she missed a talk by Xin Zhou, of the University of California, Santa Barbara, who began with a prefatory reference to one of Dr. Uhlenbeck’s 40-year-old theorems at the top of the chalkboard.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">

 one of the remaining open problems in minimal surfaces, invoked her work as an inspiration. “If there had been no Uhlenbeck theorem, people would not dare to try,” he said.

 Fernando Codá Marques, a mathematician at Princeton, had been invited to organize the special year around some of his particularly spectacular work — beginning with a
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.6501" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  2013
 </a>
 result achieved with his collaborator André Neves, at the University of Chicago.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Since then, Dr. Marques, Dr. Neves and others have been searching out
 <!-- -->
 minimal surfaces in closed spaces of various dimensions.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Previously, the best result, long forgotten, dated to
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://press.princeton.edu/titles/1725.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  1981
 </a>
 and showed that in any three- or higher-dimensional space, there is always at least one minimal surface. “We were curious if there were more,” said Dr. Marques.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 There are, according to the bubbles. A
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08816" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  new proof
 </a>
 by Antoine Song, a doctoral student of Dr. Marques, rounded out a series of results showing that there are actually infinitely many minimal surfaces, and that they are densely packed and equidistributed.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s hard to fathom, even for Dr. Uhlenbeck.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “I’m impressed with the statistical theorems that say that minimal surfaces are all over the place,” she said. “Those kinds of theorems are quite impressive, and a little bit hard to believe.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 One way to understand, or at least contemplate, the nuances of Dr. Uhlenbeck’s work is to consider the challenge of scale. She started drawing about ten years ago — outdoor scenes, mostly — and this led to an unexpected revelation: “I discovered the fascinating fact that the problem of scale occurs both in mathematics and in drawing.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In drawing, you try to capture both the large scale (the expanse of the forest) and the small scale (the grasses and flowers). “In mathematics, there is very much the same thing,” she said. “The hardest part with both is fitting the two scales together. You need the right tools.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In physics, she noted, quantum theory deals with the very small, while general relativity deals with the very large, and physicists don’t yet know how to reconcile the two.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dr. Uhlenbeck’s bubbling dealt with a similar challenge: she observed intricate phenomenon at the small scale, and then she invented tools to investigate regions of interest at a larger, more accessible scale: “You simply blow them up and look at them as if under a magnifying glass, and then you can see what’s happening.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 With this approach she also enabled other theorists to tackle some messy, turkey-on-the-floor situations.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “I’ve had several run-ins with bubbling,” said Edward Witten, a physicist in the institute’s school of natural sciences, lounging on the sofa in his office before his speech at the Abel Prize party.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He tried to explain how the “bubbling of instantons” has various important applications and implications in both mathematics and quantum field theory. (An instanton is an event in space-time, nothing like a champagne reception.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 For mathematicians, Dr. Witten explained, the bubbling of instantons was a technical obstacle in understanding four-dimensional spaces. “For physicists it isn’t just a technical obstacle,” he said. “It also contains secrets. It was the key mystery to understand.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 After bubbling, Dr. Uhlenbeck moved on to other mathematical mysteries for a few decades, but over the last year she has returned to minimal surfaces. Every Friday, her collaborator Penny Smith visits from Lehigh University to talk math. After the Abel Prize whirlwind, Dr. Uhlenbeck, exhausted, took two Fridays off. But when their sessions resume, they’ll dive deep into some even higher-dimensional bubbling.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Here, Dr. Uhlenbeck said, “It gets much messier.”

  how you would die inside a black hole

 is one of the biggest debates in physics. Called the firewall paradox, it was posited in March 2012 by a group of theorists including Donald Marolf, Ahmed Almheiri, James Sully and Joseph Polchinski.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Based on the mathematics in Einstein’s general theory of relativity of 1915, you would fall through the event horizon unscathed, then the force of gravity would pull you into a noodle and ultimately cram you into singularity, the black hole’s infinitely dense core.
</p><p class="css-1uuihdo">
 Einstein presented his general theory of relativity more than 100 years ago.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But Dr. Polchinski and his team pitted Einstein against quantum theory, which posited that
 <!-- -->
 an event horizon is

 a blazing firewall of energy that would torch your body to smithereens. However, the presence of a firewall would violate the precious principles of relativity, which decreed the existence of black holes. And so physics is stuck.

 .
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The notes stayed in the galaxy and never reached us, but we couldn’t have heard them anyway. The lowest note the human ear can detect has an oscillation period of one-twentieth of a second. This B flat’s period was 10 million years.

 Although no black hole is close enough to Earth to pull the planet to its doom, there are
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://hubblesite.org/explore_astronomy/black_holes/encyc_mod3_q7.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  so many black holes
 </a>
 in the universe that counting them is impossible. Nearly every galaxy — our own Milky Way, as well as the 100 billion or so other galaxies visible from Earth — shows signs of a supermassive black hole in its center.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Moreover the bigger a galaxy is, the more massive is its central black hole. Nobody knows why.
</p><p class="css-1uuihdo">
 A planet-sized network of radio telescopes has assembled the first image of a black hole.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Of the billions of stars in the Milky Way, about one in every 1,000 new stars is massive enough to become a black hole. Our sun is not. But a star 25 times heavier is. Stellar-mass black holes result from the death of these stars, and can exist anywhere in the galaxy.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 On July 2, 1967, a network of satellites recorded an explosion of gamma rays coming from outer space. In retrospect, it was one of the first indications that black holes are real. Today, scientists believe that a gamma ray burst is the final breath of a dying star and the birth of a stellar-mass black hole.

  dramatic transformation
 </a>
 starts when a massive star runs out of fuel. As the star begins to collapse, it explodes. The star’s outer layers spew out into space, but the inside implodes, becoming denser and denser, until there is too much matter in too little space. The core succumbs to its own gravitational pull and collapses into itself, in extreme cases forming a black hole.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Theoretically, if you shrank any mass down into a certain amount of space, it could become a black hole. Our planet would be one if you tried to cram Earth into a pea.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 On March 28, 2011, astronomers detected a long gamma ray burst coming from the center of a galaxy 4 billion light-years away. This was the first time humans observed what might have been
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/21/science/space/21obhole.html?module=inline" title="">

 </a>
 .
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 No matter what a black hole eats — a star, a donkey, an iPhone, your grammar teacher — it’s all the same to the black hole. “A black hole has no hair,” the physicist John Archibald Wheeler once said, meaning that a black hole remembers only the mass, spin and charge of its dinner.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The more a black hole eats, the more it grows. In 2011, scientists discovered one of the
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/06/science/space/astronomers-find-biggest-black-holes-yet.html?module=inline" title="">
  biggest black holes ever
 </a>
 , more than 300 million light-years away. It weighs enough to have gobbled up 21 billion suns. Scientists want to know if the biggest black holes are the result of two holes merging or one hole eating a lot.
 <!-- -->
 But scientists don’t know how they grew so large.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Light can’t escape a black hole, so seeing what’s inside one is impossible. Getting a picture of a black hole’s edge is difficult, and getting a clear picture is something else entirely.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And until now, it has never been done.
 <!-- -->
 So far, scientists have detected black holes only indirectly, by their signatures, such as a gamma ray burst, supernova or, perhaps, an object on the brink of a black hole’s event horizon. Typically, if tremendous energy is emanating from a massive core at the center of a galaxy, the core is probably a black hole.

In April 2017 scientists staked out eight telescopes atop mountains on four continents, synchronized them, pointed them at the sky and waited. And so they brought Einstein’s monster, the black hole, into view for the first time.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Quantum effects suggest that, as Hawking radiation leaks into the universe, a black hole will dissipate, eventually. It would take many times the age of the universe for a black hole to fully evaporate.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Like Einstein, Dr. Hawking at first did not believe his own theory. But the numbers were right. Physicists now view his result as the backbone for whatever future theory will bring together gravity and quantum theory.

 </a>
 in 2008, critics worried that smashing together protons in a 17-mile ring underground would create a black hole that would swallow the earth.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Scientists had smaller ones in mind. In theory, the search for the smallest particles in the universe might kick up mini black holes in the collider’s underground tubes, enabling researchers to observe general relativity and quantum mechanics in action, and perhaps open the door to solving the firewall paradox.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 A decade earlier, similarly apocalyptic worries arose over
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/11/science/physicists-strive-to-build-a-black-hole.html?pagewanted=2&amp;module=inline" title="">
  Brookhaven National Laboratory’s Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider
 </a>
 . The center’s scientists squelched these concerns by pointing out that, according to their calculations, ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays were already penetrating the atmosphere and would have created about 100 tiny black holes on Earth every year. If tiny black holes were a genuine problem, Earth would have collapsed into infinity long ago.

 Judith Leiber — the brand best known for its eye-catching, crystal-encrusted evening bags in quirky shapes like a spaniel or a bundle of asparagus — is about to introduce a new category of products that is firmly in sync with its evening-friendly designs: jewelry.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The collection, which will be available in May, is vast: more than 700 items, from single stud earrings priced at slightly less than $100 to a chunky link bracelet in a rainbow pattern that will be almost $1,000. Most items will be gold vermeil and covered in cubic zirconia; many echo the style of the bags, with shapes like fast-food French fries, cupcakes and cocktail glasses.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 About a third of the designs were inspired by the brand’s archives, said Dee Ocleppo Hilfiger, its co-owner, creative director and global brand ambassador (and wife of Tommy) — and many, like charms of cassette tapes and old-school boomboxes, have a vintage feel.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “It’s kind of a natural extension because the bags themselves — the minaudières — are almost pieces of jewelry themselves,” Ms. Hilfiger said in a recent phone interview from her yacht off the coast of St. Barts.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ms. Hilfiger became a minority shareholder in 2017, four years after Authentic Brands Group acquired the Leiber brand. It also owns brands like Herve Leger.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Although the company had produced some jewelry over the years, including a collaboration with Harry Winston, it has never before produced a collection of this size.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ms. Leiber, the company’s founder,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/30/obituaries/judith-leiber-97-dies-turned-handbags-into-objets-dart.html?module=inline" title="">
  died last year
 </a>
 . She hadn’t designed the brand’s bags since the late 1990s.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The company’s spunky style happens to be especially in vogue. “We’ve been talking about an uptrend in novelty,” said Claire Foster, director of accessories and footwear at the trend forecasting firm WGSN, “grounded in a lot of the uncertainty that we’re seeing in the world, generally through politics, and the economy and things like that. We’ve seen novelty, kitsch and playfulness coming back into the sphere.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Over the past few years, many contemporary celebrities, including Beyoncé, Rihanna and Kim Kardashian West, have carried Lieber bags to events. “The glitter and diamond fascination kind of came back into style,” said Dani Michelle, a Los Angeles-based stylist whose clients include Kourtney Kardashian. “When you talk about that type of aesthetic, Judith Leiber takes the cake for that glitter story.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Initially the jewelry collection will be available only on
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://judithleiber.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  the brand’s website
 </a>
 . Judith Leiber Couture, as the handbag line is now called, is carried by stores like Harrods, Lane Crawford, Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Offering the jewelry at a comparatively modest price point is deliberate, Ms. Hilfiger said: “For the girl that loves Judith Leiber but maybe can’t afford a $5,000 French fry bag, she can wear a beautiful pendant and have that same whimsical statement without spending that kind of money.”

 Fans of AMC’s “The Walking Dead” will be meeting a new group of survivors next year in a new spinoff that will center on two young women.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The spinoff was cocreated by

 The original TV series, which is based on the Walking Dead comic book created by Robert Kirkman and published by Image, had its debut in 2010 and

 “Showing audiences an unseen pocket of ‘The Walking Dead’ universe steeped in a new mythology is a very cool way to celebrate a ‘Decade of the Dead’ on TV and over 15 years of Robert Kirkman’s brilliant comic,” Gimple said in a statement announcing the show.

 The new series will focus on characters who are the first generation of survivors to come of age in a world overrun by zombies. The announcement promised: “Some will become heroes. Some will become villains. In the end, all of them will be changed forever.”

 The board is now Burnham’s.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or so it seems. So much of this season of “Star Trek: Discovery” is about control. Of course, there is the literal villain — Control — the malevolent artificial intelligence which aims to wipe out all sentient life in the universe. A charming fellow, that one.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And then there is the concept of control: So many characters struggle to take command of their own destinies, even though with the time travel element, it is a futile battle. Some characters — Saru, for example — have done better with this than others.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But no character has had her life upended due to events beyond her control like Burnham. Whether it is investigating what happened with Spock, the re-emergence of her mother or the loss of her friend Airiam, Burham is running from one emotional shock to the next. Her life has been full of suffering from a young age. The Vulcans shun her. Her adoptive father doesn’t think highly of her human background. Her biological parents were murdered — and she only finds out decades later the real reason.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In “Perpetual Infinity,” Burnham is teased with the slightest bit of happiness: Her mother is within arm’s reach and finally they can be together. Of course, there is a containment field between the two of them, and by the end of the episode, Burnham has lost her once again — this time, likely for good. She’s less a Vulcan than a Buddhist: Life is suffering.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 At the very start of the episode, the Discovery crew awakens Burnham from the dead, because in the “Discovery” universe, death is merely a construct. No one really dies. There is only struggle and even
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  that
 </em>
 is pointless.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Control takes over Leland’s body, essentially, to fool his Starfleet colleagues into doing the artificial intelligence’s bidding. I am not
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  entirely
 </em>
 sure what Control is, but there are some theories that this is an early form of the Borg.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 I’m not sure I buy that: Control is focused on destruction, whereas the Borg on perfection. (And selfishly, I am
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  really
 </em>
 hoping this isn’t the Borg. The most terrifying villains in Trek history do not need an origin story. Their mystery adds to the intrigue.) A side note: How did Control restrain Leland to the chair?
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 As far as last week’s big revelation, Burnham’s mother, Gabrielle, played admirably by Sonja Sohn, is trapped in Burnham’s time. She appears to not be able to stay in different time periods for long, because an anchor of some sort keeps pulling her to a spot where organic life has been wiped out: apparently 950 years into the future from when Klingons appeared to kill her and her husband.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 She doesn’t want to speak to her daughter. She only wants to speak to Pike, to whom she says, “I could say more about your future, but you won’t like it,” an Easter egg for Trekkies well aware of Pike ending up in a wheelchair. Gabrielle wants Discovery to destroy the sphere’s data archive (a potentially invaluable resource), without which Control can’t evolve. When mother and daughter finally see each other, Gabrielle is cold. She says she’s let Burnham go: “There’s only the bigger picture now. Nothing else.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Destroying the sphere doesn’t work, so the Discovery crew hatches a plan, with some incoherent technobabble: They’re going to launch the time traveling suit and the sphere so far into the future that, somehow, this will save sentient life in the universe. And somehow, they’ll be able to get Gabrielle to stay in the current time too.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Possessed Leland disrupts these plans — this isn’t what Control wants. He stabs Tyler, who of course lives, and warns the Discovery crew that Leland is coming to the surface to cause a ruckus. Here, of course, some Starfleet crew members appear to die. The reason they die is because the audience doesn’t know their names.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The gambit from Leland doesn’t quite work, but it requires Gabrielle to sacrifice herself in order to send the suit and the sphere into the future. Problem solved! But unfortunately, Burnham is in deep pain once again.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Perpetual Infinity,” written by Alan McElroy and Brandon Schultz, was tightly focused but heavy on exposition. It also was stuffed with technobabble to the point that its developments were a bit difficult to follow.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 As she often does, Sonequa Martin-Green made the episode a compelling watch. She plays Burnham’s vulnerability very well. I would have liked to see Sohn stick around for a bit more of the story line, but “Discovery” writers like to fool the audience. She might be back before we know it.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Once again, I am left wondering what Tyler’s role is here. He seems to have a moral center, but his abilities seem minimal for someone in Section 31. And we seem to have forgotten why he made it to Section 31 to begin with: L’Rell staged his death to allow him to escape Klingons who doubted his loyalties.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 I try not to watch teaser trailers for next week because I like the surprise, so I am at a loss of where the story goes next. Is the universe safe from Control? Are we good? Can we give Burnham something to smile about?

 NEW YORK — Seven films in, the DC Extended Universe is finally flying with some wind behind its back. The well-reviewed, more modestly budgeted "Shazam!" debuted with $53.5 million over the weekend.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "Shazam!" has collected an estimated $56.8 million in total, including about $3 million from early advance screenings. Made for about $100 million, "Shazam!" follows recent DC successes such as "Aquaman" and "Wonder Woman."
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Paramount Pictures' "Pet Sematary" remake opened in second with $25 million. It's a decent start for the Stephen King adaptation, though far from the haul that the last big-screen adaptation of King's conjured up. "It" opened with $123.4 million in 2017.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Last week's top film, "Dumbo," slid to third with $18.2 million.

 When “Game of Thrones” finally wraps up on May 19, at least one of the story’s central figures would like the end to be the actual end.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Why [expletive] with it?” Emilia Clarke, the Dragon Queen herself, said recently.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “It’s a phenomenon that no one ever saw coming, so I completely understand why anyone would be like, let’s make 1,500 more since that’s a recipe that works,” she added. “I just don’t think they should.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Pop culture trends and market pressures might ultimately work against her, however, and a prequel pilot is already in the works. So as HBO’s biggest ever hit prepares to begin its final season on April 14,
 <!-- -->
 a
 <!-- -->
 definitional question hangs over its future: Is “Game of Thrones” a series? Or is it a universe?
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Based on viewing, industry impact and global attention, “Thrones” is one of the biggest blockbusters in TV history. But as giant corporations buy one another and plan bottomless new streaming platforms in an ever more feverish battle for your eyeballs and entertainment dollars, blockbusters are not enough anymore.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So while there are only six episodes remaining in the sprawling saga of Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, Tyrion and friends, we’ve likely only begun exploring Westeros.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Consider “Star Wars.” Since Disney
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/30/disney-buying-lucas-films-for-4-billion/" title="">
  bought Lucasfilm in 2012 for $4 billion
 </a>
 , it has strip-mined the franchise, conceiving
 <!-- -->
 multiple
 <!-- -->
 movie trilogies, stand-alone films and TV series, as well as an enormous presence in Disney’s theme parks. (Next up for the “Thrones” creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss: A series of

 .)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or Harry Potter (like “Game of Thrones,” part of the

 <!-- -->
 which
 <!-- -->
 after the eight films based on the books is now deep into the “Fantastic Beasts” prequel series, and also has tourist attractions

  all over the world
 </a>
 .
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Or the mightiest pop culture universe of all: Disney’s Marvel, which later this month
 <!-- -->
 will close out the “Avengers” filament of the Marvelverse, with “Avengers: Endgame,” but in June
 <!-- -->
 extend the X-Men branch with “Dark Phoenix,” starring Sansa Stark herself, Sophie Turner.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So wouldn’t the phenomenally popular (and lucrative) “Game of Thrones” be a prime candidate for a similar treatment?
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The case in favor includes nearly every detail surrounding the show. In February, AT&amp;T received
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/business/media/att-time-warner-appeal.html?module=inline" title="">
  final clearance
 </a>
 for its $85.4 billion merger with HBO’s corporate parent Time Warner, and will launch a
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/10/business/media/warner-media-streaming.html?module=inline" title="">
  WarnerMedia streaming platform
 </a>
 to compete with coming services from Disney — which also just closed a
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/business/media/walt-disney-21st-century-fox-deal.html?module=inline" title="">
  $71.3 billion deal
 </a>
 to buy 21st Century Fox — and
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/technology/apple-news-streaming-service.html?module=inline" title="">
  Apple
 </a>
 , along with the existing stalwarts Netflix, Amazon and Hulu.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The streaming service will draw from Warner’s vast collection of films and shows from properties like Warner Bros. and Turner as well as HBO. HBO Now, the network’s current streaming app, is expected to stick around but HBO’s original series and other offerings will be incorporated into the WarnerMedia service, meaning “Game of Thrones” could appear alongside the likes of Harry Potter movies, “Wonder Woman” and “Friends.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 John Stankey, the AT&amp;T executive put in charge of WarnerMedia, has said HBO will get a bigger programming budget in order to
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/08/business/media/hbo-att-merger.html?module=inline" title="">
  ramp up production
 </a>
 . “We want to increase our investment in premium content,” he said last summer on an earnings call. How much, if any, of that content will be “Thrones”-related is an open question. (AT&amp;T declined to comment.) But the telecom presumably didn’t buy Time Warner just to let one of its most valuable pieces of intellectual property go dark.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Thrones” is also already based on a universe, the Song of Ice and Fire series created by George R.R. Martin, that is so dense with history and lore, it could fuel dozens of series and
 <!-- -->
 movies
 <!-- -->
 .
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “The universe is too rich

 to try,” said Casey Bloys, HBO’s president of programming. “But on the other hand, I also don’t want to do it just to do it.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The prequel pilot, created by Martin and Jane Goldman, will go into production this summer. Set thousands of years before the events of “Game of Thrones,” it will
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hbo.com/hbo-news/game-of-thrones-prequel-what-to-know" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  explore the history
 </a>
 of the White Walkers and the Stark family, and star Naomi Watts and Miranda Richardson, among others. It was one of multiple prequel concepts commissioned by HBO, which hasn’t ruled out moving forward with any of the others at some point.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And starting next year, “Thrones” fans — like “Star Wars,” Potter and Marvel devotees — will be able to get their fix in the flesh.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Game of Thrones Studio Tour, a 110,000-square-foot tourist attraction, is slated to open in spring 2020 in Northern Ireland, where most of the show was produced. The project, inspired by Warner Bros.’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/travel/studio-tour-casts-spells-like-harry-potter.html?module=inline" title="">
  Harry Potter studio tour outside London
 </a>
 , will transform the Linen Mill Studios in Banbridge, where parts of “Thrones” were shot, into an interactive exhibition of the show’s sets, costumes, props and weapons.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “It’s going to be an immersive experience where fans will feel like they are inside their favorite sets from the show,” said Jeff Peters, HBO’s vice president for licensing and retail.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Linen Mill Studios will be the first of as many as four former “Thrones” filming locations in Northern Ireland to be transformed into interactive fan experiences — other possibilities include the still-standing sets for King’s Landing, in Belfast, and Castle Black and the Wall, in a quarry outside the city. While there are not currently plans to create similar attractions in the United States, “it’s possible,” Peters said. “We get pitched all the time, and we’re open to a lot of different opportunities.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s worth noting that there are some potential obstacles to “Game of Thrones” becoming the next “Star Wars.” One is the firmly TV-MA tenor of the series — the risqué material precludes youngsters from fueling the franchise as actively as they do for others. (HBO argues that this will keep “Thrones” relevant even if it doesn’t add more series, as new generations discover the saga.)
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Another is HBO itself. The network became the crown jewel of television through its taste and commitment to quality (the occasional “Arli$$” notwithstanding). It’s known for walking away from numerous pilots that didn’t meet its standard, and will only turn the prequel into an actual series if it lives up to “Thrones,” Bloys said. “I want to honor the high bar that Dan and David set with the original show,” he said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 As a result, it’s way too early to even start thinking of “Thrones” as a franchise, he added.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “To me, franchise denotes multiple films or multiple TV shows living at the same time,” he said. “Not having even turned a camera on the prequel just yet, it’s premature to say at this point, to declare we’re going to have multiple series living at once.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 AT&amp;T, however, has shown no signs of being a hands-off or particularly patient owner. The former HBO chief executive Richard Plepler, as responsible as anyone for the network’s taste-making reputation, abruptly
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/business/media/richard-plepler-hbo-ceo.html?module=inline" title="">
  left the company
 </a>
 two days after the Warner purchase received final clearance.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 There are already signs that AT&amp;T plans to treat “Thrones” as one more synergistic cog in its corporate machine. Kristian Nairn, who played the fan favorite Hodor, was tapped to appear this week
 <!-- -->
 at an AT&amp;T store in Boston, where customers could also enter a sweepstakes for a seat on a “Dragon Wagon” to the season premiere
 <!-- -->
 in New York.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 One faction that is not much interested in any new versions of “Game of Thrones”: the stars of “Game of Thrones.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 None of the current “Thrones” actors are involved with the pilot or have had any role in its development. The prequel “came as a shock to all of us,” Clarke said.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The general sentiment from Clarke and others about any future “Thrones” series amounts to basically, I wish them the best, I had the time of my life, but I’m out. (One exception: the ever cagey Varys. “Never say never,” said Conleth Hill, who plays him.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This isn’t terribly surprising, given the length and physical demands of “Game of Thrones” — and who knows which characters will survive the final season? But the ongoing loosening of TV formats would seem to open up plenty of opportunities, even for characters that get killed off. What “Thrones” fan wouldn’t want a mini-series or HBO movie depicting prehistory like, say, Robert’s Rebellion and the events that turned Jaime Lannister into the Kingslayer?
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who plays Jaime, hopes the prequel is “even more successful than ‘Game of Thrones,’” he said. But he’s not interested in ever returning to Westeros.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “You could only set yourself up for disappointment,” he said. “It’s been an amazing 10 years, but 10 years is a fair amount of time.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Don’t count on a Sansa mini-series either. “I never want to be in a corset ever again,” Turner said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 That said, there could be other opportunities for “Thrones” veterans if the show expands into the next great franchise. Its stars might be at the pinnacle of the pop culture universe now, as the final season draws near, but some have been around long enough to know how quickly such things can change.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “The cast members that now are so confident about the future,” Coster-Waldau said. “Five years from now we will all be guides at the Game of Thrones Land.”

 The discussion of modernized farming methods might not sound like the stuff of romance novels, but that all depends on how handsome the man doing the talking is. Lisa Kleypas’s
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  DEVIL’S DAUGHTER (Avon, paper, $7.99)
 </strong>
 is the platonic ideal of historical romance, witty and lush and tender all at once. Phoebe is a young widow and mother of two boys, just coming out of mourning for her beloved husband. She heads to her brother’s wedding festivities knowing that West Ravenel, her husband’s boarding school tormentor, will be there, as he’s the bride’s cousin. What she doesn’t expect is to find a man who makes her feel “that shaky, embarrassing, inexplicable desire to press her body intimately against someone else’s.” Even less expected (for Phoebe, but a delightful setup for the reader): That man is West Ravenel.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Kleypas wisely spreads the developments that follow over several months instead of cramming them into the wedding weekend; while Phoebe and West’s attraction is instant, their capitulation is not. West, a younger son, is manager of his family’s estate, and soon he begins to mentor Phoebe, who’s responsible for her own land until her sons come of age. West advocates for modernized farming, and even camaraderie with his tenant farmers — it is 1877, after all.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The gulf between the school-age West Ravenel of whom Phoebe had heard such horrific tales and the funny, generous, thoughtful man she comes to know is, thankfully, reconciled without any illogically hoarded secrets or overwrought reveals. Just as nicely handled is Phoebe’s first love — though her relationship with her first husband bloomed gently out of a childhood friendship, it’s never disparaged for lacking the heat that Phoebe feels with West. It’s a view of love as cleareyed and mature as everything else in this book, though in Phoebe and West’s case, Kleypas proves that cleareyed and mature doesn’t preclude pulse-raising.

 Paranormal romances can have a daunting buy-in. Elaborate world-building can make catching up mid-series difficult — and authors must walk a delicate line between high fantasy and unintentional camp. All of this makes Maria Vale’s

 </strong>
 an impressive accomplishment: It’s Book 3 in a series but a welcoming starting point, and Vale’s world of werewolves, though grave, is never self-serious. Crucial to this success is Vale’s narrator, Varya, once an outsider, now a ranking member of the pack. (There’s a lot of lore to learn about Varya’s pack, from hierarchical structure to phrases in the pack’s Old Tongue, which looks a lot like Old English, but Vale keeps everything accessible.) Varya is intense and severe, almost caught off-guard by the feelings she develops for the lone wolf she finds one day, nearly dying of injuries he sustained when caught in an illegal trap.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 To back up for a moment, I should explain Vale’s wolves. They don’t call themselves werewolves — and scoff at humans who would — but that’s roughly what they are, able to shift between human and wolf forms, except for three days around the full moon, when all must be wolves. The pack’s greatest enemies aren’t meddling humans, but Shifters, who’ve abandoned the deep traditions of pack life — and the pull of the moon — to integrate into, and profit from, human society. Some pack members also live in the human world, protecting the pack’s legal and financial interests, but as a new threat from Shifters encroaches, they’re all called home to the pack’s land in the Adirondacks. And as that crisis escalates, Varya must keep the secret of the strange lone wolf she’s found, and of her growing feelings for him. That wolf, Eyulf, is appealingly affable, but Varya’s a surprising pleasure for a reader to spend time with. She’s often stoic and severe, with a reserve born out of early trauma, but she also has a powerful yearning for connection. Watching her come to terms with her own vulnerability is as moving, and central to the story, as watching her and Eyulf fall in love.

 Like many romances, Sarina Bowen’s
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  OVERNIGHT SENSATION (Tuxbury, paper, $15)
 </strong>
 hinges on some minor plot acrobatics to force its central couple to spend time together. It’s not enough that Heidi Jo Pepper is the office intern for the Brooklyn Bruisers, the hockey team on which Jason Castro plays. Well, it almost is, at first, when at a post-practice bar one night the two are about to give in to a long-simmering attraction. But then Heidi, a perpetual good girl thrilled with the possibility of being approximately 2 percent bad, overdoes it on tequila shots, and Jason has her crash on his couch when she refuses to go home so drunk, because home would be Daddy’s condo. And Daddy, Jason soon realizes, is the league’s commissioner. Daddy is also plenty pissed when he sees a gossip-blog photo of Jason carrying a very drunk Heidi back to his apartment.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Heidi’s already in hot water for dropping out of college, so Daddy downgrades her internship to a 10-week rotation through some of the hockey league’s most menial jobs — selling hot dogs, working stadium security, cleaning bathrooms. She can’t say no — there’s the hope of a permanent position at the end of her trials — but she can’t handle staying in Daddy’s condo anymore. And so that is why Heidi keeps living with Jason (and his teammate roommate). In practice, this plot feels elaborate but not overwrought, anchored by Heidi’s sincere drive to figure out who she is when she’s not the good Southern girl she’s been raised to be. Her slightly strange, slightly manic energy keeps her arc feeling fresh; Jason’s need to learn to talk about his feelings comes across as a bit more pat, but, sadly, isn’t unrealistic. And there’s so much more happening in this sprightly book — Heidi’s odd jobs, two entire unrelated scandals, plenty of hockey — that as soon as the momentum flags you’re on to the next play.

 The world of speculative romance is rife with werewolves and shape-shifters, angels and demons and oh so many vampires, but spaceships are woefully thin on the ground (and in the air). Even if that weren’t the case, even if some of us weren’t desperate for romance to colonize the cosmos, Jessie Mihalik’s splendid

  POLARIS RISING

 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">

 </strong>
 would be a thrill of a book. Ada von Hasenberg is the fifth child of one of the three royal houses of the universe’s ruling Consortium. She’s been on the run for the last two years, fleeing an arranged marriage with the son of a rival house. When she finds herself about to be captured by her intended, she manages to escape with a fellow prisoner: Marcus Loch, the Devil of Fornax Zero, and the most wanted man in the universe. Ada soon discovers that the small ship they’ve stolen for their escape holds secrets that could topple the universe’s delicate balance of power.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mihalik’s universe is vividly imagined, with exposition given with a refreshing directness (and no reliance on characters spouting awkward as-you-knows). The book is told entirely from Ada’s point of view, offering the reader no more insight past Loch’s cold exterior than Ada herself has. It’s a risk on Mihalik’s part — Loch starts out menacing and mysterious, and he always remains a bit opaque — but it pays off as the reader, right along with Ada, gets to treasure every small crack in his stoic facade. Besides, Ada’s a tremendous heroine, brilliant and capable but never infallible, and I wouldn’t want to give up a moment with her. The set pieces skew toward sci-fi, but the burgeoning attraction between Ada and Loch is just as important to the story. This is space-opera adventure and sweeping romance in equal parts, an enthralling and eminently satisfying book.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Like terrified moviegoers seated on the edges of their seats and at the mercy of their imaginations, astronomers expect this week to finally see the monster: a supermassive black hole.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 At 9 a.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday April 10, a group of astronomers who run a globe-girdling network of radio telescopes called the

 are expected to unveil their long awaited pictures of a pair of putative black holes. One of the objects sits at the center of the Milky Way galaxy, buried in the depths of interstellar dust and gas, and equivalent in mass to 4.1 million suns that otherwise have disappeared from the visible universe.

 The other target is in the heart of Messier 87, a giant galaxy in the constellation Virgo, where a black hole 7 billion times the mass of the sun is spewing a jet of energy thousands of light-years across space.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 According to calculations, and if all has gone well, either or both of the black holes should appear as a tiny shadow backlit by the glow of radio energy at the galactic center.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 They might be circular, oval or some other shape entirely, depending on whether they are rotating, or if the Einsteinian equations describing them are slightly wrong, or if they are spitting flares of energy, which is how quasars produce fireworks visible across the universe.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">

 mingle with history and memory. For the first time, astronomers will be staring down the pipes of eternity.
</p><p class="css-1uuihdo">
 Welcome to the place of no return — a region in space where the gravitational pull is so strong that not even light can escape it. This is a black hole.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 If, in fact, astronomers have finally brought the monsters into view at last. The Event Horizon team has been extremely tight-lipped. Nobody knows for certain if either of these black holes, if any, has been imaged.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Shep Doeleman, director of the Event Horizon Telescope, was ebullient but guarded when reached last week at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. “The team is working exceptionally hard to quadruple-check all the results,” he said.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But he and his colleagues are acting as if they have something to celebrate. The announcement of their results will take place simultaneously in six places around the world, reflecting the vast international nature of the collaboration. One news conference, at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. will be presided over by France Córdova, head of the National Science Foundation. The team and their friends have booked the National Air and Space Museum for a party that evening.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The unveiling will take place almost exactly a century after images of
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/31/science/eclipse-einstein-general-relativity.html?module=inline" title="">
  stars askew in the heavens
 </a>
 made Einstein famous and confirmed his theory of general relativity as the law of the cosmos. That theory ascribes gravity to the warping of space and time by matter and energy, much as a mattress sags under a sleeper, and allows for the contents of the universe, including light rays, to follow curved paths.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 General relativity led to a new conception of the cosmos, in which space-time could quiver, bend, rip, expand, swirl like a mix-master and even disappear forever into the maw of a black hole.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 To Einstein’s surprise, the equations indicated that when too much matter or energy was concentrated in one place, space-time could collapse, trapping matter and light in perpetuity.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Einstein disliked that idea, but the consensus today is that the universe is speckled with black holes waiting to vacuum up their surroundings. Many are the gravitational tombstones of stars that have burned up their fuel and collapsed.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Any lingering doubts as to their existence vanished three years ago when the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, detected
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/science/ligo-gravitational-waves-black-holes-einstein.html?module=inline" title="">
  the collision of a pair of distant black holes, which sent a shiver through
 </a>
 the fabric of space-time.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Since then, other collisions have been recorded, and black holes have become so humdrum that astronomers no longer bother sending out news releases about them.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Nonetheless, astronomers are thrilled at the prospect of finally, actually seeing the previously unseeable.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Yes, I’m definitely excited to see the image!” Daniel Holz, of the University of Chicago, wrote in an email. “It’s not really rational, since I know the math works and the theory has been thoroughly tested. But still, this would be a picture of the real thing, up close and personal. That is super cool.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Priyamvada Natarajan, a Yale astrophysicist who is not part of the project, said, “It’s exciting, even just technically, to get this up close and personal to a black hole.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Especially when the black hole is no run-of-the-mill stellar corpse, but one of the behemoths that crouch in the centers of galaxies and direct cosmic weather, launching thunderbolts across thousands of light-years.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Even if the new images do not overthrow relativity, they will be invaluable as astronomers’ first glimpses into the hearts of these entities and the way they generate cosmically catastrophic energies.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The center of the Milky Way, 26,000 light-years from Earth, coincides with a faint source of radio noise called Sagittarius A* (pronounced A-star). By tracking the orbits of stars around this hub, astronomers have calculated that whatever sits at the center has the mass of four million suns.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But it emits no visible or infrared light. If this is not a black hole, no one knows what it could be. The only way to be sure is to peer through the haze and record the shadow of oblivion.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Which is no small job. According to the standard Einstein calculations, a black hole with the mass of 4.1 million suns would be only about 15 million miles wide — a tiny area to observe clearly from this distance. Luckily, the black hole’s gravity will magnify it to appear twice that size. But discerning even that is like trying to spot an orange on the Moon with the naked eye.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It takes a big telescope to see something so small. Enter the Event Horizon Telescope, named for a black hole’s point of no return; whatever crosses the event horizon falls into blackness everlasting. The telescope was the dream-child of Dr. Doeleman, who was inspired to study black holes by examining the mysterious activity in the centers of violent radio galaxies such as M87.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 By combining data from radio telescopes as far apart as the South Pole, France, Chile and Hawaii, using a technique called very long baseline interferometry, Dr. Doeleman and his colleagues created a telescope as big as Earth itself.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The network has gained antennas and sensitivity over the last decade. In April of 2017, the network of eight telescopes, synchronized by atomic clocks, stared at the Milky Way center and at the giant galaxy M87 off and on for 10 days.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Astronomers have taken the last two years to reduce and collate the results. The data were too voluminous to transmit over the internet, and so had to be placed on hard disks and flown back to M.I.T.’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.haystack.mit.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

  Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy
 </a>
 , in Bonn, Germany.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The data from the South Pole could not arrive before December 2017, Dr. Doeleman said, “because it was Antarctic winter, when nothing could go in or out.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Last year the team divided into four independent groups to assemble images from the data dump. To stay objective and guard against bias, the teams had no contact with each other, Dr. Doeleman said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In the meantime, the telescope kept growing. In April 2018, a telescope in Greenland was added to the collaboration. Another observation run was made of the Milky Way and M87, and captured twice the amount of data gathered in 2017.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “We’ve hitched our wagon to a bandwidth rocket,” Dr. Doeleman said. The new observations won’t be included in Wednesday’s reveal, but they will allow the astronomers to check the 2017 results and to track changes in the black holes as the years go by.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “The plan is to carry out these observations indefinitely,” said Dr. Doeleman, embarking on his new career as a tamer of extragalactic beasts, “and see how things change.”
</p><p class="css-1e7dx92 evys1bk0">
 An earlier version of this article misstated the width of a black hole with a mass of 4.1 million suns. It is about 15 million miles, not 24 million miles.

 The above pairing of “Captain Marvel” with the rival DC Comics-born “Wonder Woman” might be considered treason by loyalists to the Marvel Cinematic Universe — that ever-ballooning franchise of superhero movies that includes Marvel and Disney collaborations like “Captain Marvel,” “The Avengers,” “Guardians of the Galaxy” and “Black Panther.” To stick within the Marvel world, revisit “Iron Man,” the first entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The movie was hardly a modest beginning; “Iron Man” represented not only the explosive start of the film franchise but also the

 Here’s an interesting double feature: pair the war-on-terror-focused “Iron Man” with this Oliver Stone George W. Bush biopic, another relic of late-Bush-era America. An origin story that vacillates between sendup and appraisal, the film follows Bush (Josh Brolin) from his Yale days through the earlier years of his presidency. In

 American Ronin, about highly trained corporate operatives; Fight Girls, about warriors vying to be queen of the galaxy; and Bad Mother, about a parent searching for her missing daughter: These are some of the stories that are coming from a new comics publisher, Artists, Writers &amp; Artisans, one that is posing the question, what stories could we develop if we begin with a blank slate?
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In comic books, there are two main publishing models. One emphasizes flagship characters — like Batman and Spider-Man — whose success largely benefits their companies, DC and Marvel Comics. The other is creator-focused, where hits like The Walking Dead, by Robert Kirkman and published by Image Comics, can mean a financial windfall for its creators. AWA is aiming for something between the two: It will have interconnected superhero comics like DC and Marvel as well as stand-alone series like Image. And all of its creators will have a financial stake.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s an approach reminiscent of old Hollywood. “The model here really is the old United Artists model, where people who are actually doing the creative have ownership, control and decision-making power over the work that they’re doing,” said Bill Jemas, a former chief operating officer and publisher at Marvel who is the chief executive and publisher of AWA. Joining him at the helm are Axel Alonso, a former editor in chief at Marvel, as chief creative officer and Jonathan F. Miller as chairman. Miller helped broker a deal in 2017 between the comic book writer
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/behind-netflixs-bold-bet-comics-king-mark-millar-1031336" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Mark Millar and Netflix
 </a>
 , which bought his library of characters for development on the streaming service. Jemas and Alonso say the first of AWA’s titles will arrive some time this fall.

 “What we’re offering creators is an opportunity to bet on themselves without putting it all on the line,” Alonso said, during a recent conference-call interview with Jemas. Their stable of writers and artists includes both veterans and newcomers, Alonso said. They would be paid to produce the work as well as own their stories and characters, a percentage of the company or both.

  announced itself in December
 </a>
 , plans to binge-release its mini-series, simultaneously selling collected editions of those stories and offering the first issue of each comic free. AHOY Comics, which began publishing in September, is more old school, but it is trying new things: It includes extra material — prose stories, cartoons, even a crossword — in its issues, and is also publishing

 To help shape the comics, the publisher has a creative council, which includes the screenwriter and director Reginald Hudlin, the novelists

 </a>
 for MGM. “I was open to returning to comics if the project was something challenging, so when Bill and Axel approached me about creating an entirely new, cohesive, shared comic-book universe, the prospect was too much fun to resist,” he wrote in an email. Straczynski has developed the origin point of AWA’s superheroes.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He has worked for comic companies with different publishing models. At DC and Marvel, “you always kind of know where the guard rails are,” he noted, including an obligation to bend, but not break the characters. With creator-owned work, “you can go as far as you want, since only you bear the consequences if you mess it up,” he wrote. Straczynski was drawn to the blended approach of AWA. “You get to create a new universe for what has every opportunity to become a major company, while taking real chances.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In developing AWA’s superhero universe, Straczynski and Alonso took a broad look at others. Straczynski postulated that DC’s heroes, which generally emerged out of the postwar ’40s, were largely authority figures, while Marvel’s, which mostly emerged from the ’60s, were anti-establishment. “Who are we writing our stories about, and for, and what are we trying to say that’s relevant to a contemporary audience?” he wrote.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 AWA has big ambitions and hopes to create a library of material like that of Marvel. “I think it’s fairly safe to say that Marvel is the most valuable entertainment franchise in the world,” Miller said. After the Netflix deal, he wondered if there were similar opportunities. He and Jemas got together, and Alonso soon joined them. “One of the great things about doing things this way is that you get to try a lot. Some things will hit, you never know when and where, but that’s part of the idea,” he said. “As long as you keep getting your turns at bat, then you’ll get some hits.”
</p><p class="css-1e7dx92 evys1bk0">
 An earlier version of this article misidentified Bill Jemas’s role at Marvel. He was chief operating officer and publisher, not a vice president.

 LOS ANGELES — Robert Mapplethorpe’s photographs are pristine and painful, witty and wicked, forbidding and seductive. The mild-mannered Bryce Dessner is not the first composer I would have thought of to set them to music.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. Dessner — whose hourlong meditation on Mapplethorpe, “Triptych (Eyes of One on Another),” had its premiere at Walt Disney Concert Hall here on Tuesday before touring worldwide — achieved fame as a member of the rock band the National, and has sought a parallel career in the concert hall.

 </a>
 . (The New York Philharmonic will play “Wires” in November.)
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. Dessner was a teenager in Cincinnati in 1990 when a Mapplethorpe exhibition that traveled there, “The Perfect Moment,” became caught up in
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/nov/17/robert-mapplethorpe-the-perfect-moment-25-years-later" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  a classic culture-war conflagration
 </a>
 over censorship and government support for the arts. The city’s Contemporary Arts Center and its director faced obscenity charges; they were acquitted in a trial viewed as a victory for free speech.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “The Perfect Moment” drew from three Mapplethorpe portfolios: “X” (images of gay S&amp;M activity), “Y” (flower studies) and “Z” (nude portraits of black men). This tripartite structure in turn suggested a form for “Triptych,” which very loosely moves from a mythologizing overture (“it was said he had face of a god / yet some saw a demon with rope shoes”) to reflections on the obscenity trial and issues of race in his work.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The elliptical libretto, by Korde Arrington Tuttle, draws on texts by the poet Essex Hemphill, who argued that Mapplethorpe continued a long tradition of objectifying black bodies, and by Patti Smith,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/31/books/review/Carson-t.html?module=inline" title="">
  whose book “Just Kids”
 </a>
 is a memoir of her friendship with the artist. The language is stylized and extravagantly poetic, matching the photographs’ explicit sexual content while meeting their cool elegance with punk Romanticism (“worship the almighty / target practice / tells me to flex / tighten my torso”).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 These texts, while occasionally overwrought, do evoke the brew of objectification, glorification, aggression, submission, risk and reward in Mapplethorpe’s photographs, particularly those of black men. The words are not always easy on the artist; they draw an uncomfortable parallel between different meanings of “shooting” someone, and, in one section constructed as a dialogue, suggest Mapplethorpe exploited his models.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s heady, ambitious stuff. But Mr. Dessner, perhaps treading cautiously as a white composer in a potential racial minefield, keeps the music — performed by 10 vocalists and 10 instrumentalists — resolutely lukewarm.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He mines the vocal ensemble Roomful of Teeth for close harmonies, undergirding their singing with a wan wash of strings, the barest touch of propulsion. (The Los Angeles Philharmonic’s New Music Group was conducted by Sara Jobin.) The tenor Isaiah Robinson, a featured soloist, made soulful wails; his voice was richer, the emotion in it both plainer and more complex, than that of mezzo-soprano Alicia Hall Moran, his female counterpart.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 There was little sense of this blandly brooding, affectlessly luminous score shifting as the libretto did, leaving the words — only a handful of which were audible, with murky amplification partly to blame — adrift. The music can’t match the words’ nuanced portrayal of Mapplethorpe’s vision and personality, reducing the work’s impact to dreary sanctification. (I could have done without the facile queer utopianism of the finale: “Every time we kiss / we confirm the new world coming.”)
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 A slideshow of Mapplethorpe’s images was projected on a screen above the ensemble during the performance, and a young black actor moved slowly around the stage. These are perhaps suggestions of the fuller production of “Triptych” (directed by Kaneza Schaal, who replaced the originally announced Daniel Fish) that will have its premiere on March 15 in Ann Arbor, Mich., and travel to the
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.bam.org/music/2019/triptych" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Brooklyn Academy of Music
 </a>
 in June. A fleshed-out production may well enliven the piece. But if the music isn’t propelling the drama, visuals will ultimately always be window dressing.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 I know critics aren’t supposed to review performances that existed only in our imaginations. But on the drive home from Disney Hall, my mind kept wandering to what the composer Georg Friedrich Haas might have done with this material. Known for plunging his players and audiences alike into long, disconcerting stretches of total darkness,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/24/arts/music/a-composer-and-his-wife-creativity-through-kink.html?module=inline" title="">
  Mr. Haas is gifted at sonic evocations of control, oppression and extremity
 </a>
 ; his work shares the classicism of Mapplethorpe’s work, and its brutality.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 These indelible photographs deserve better music than Mr. Dessner’s thin, earnest worship.

 LOS ANGELES — A law firm that has battled companies like Intel and

  Farmers Insurance
 </a>
 over unequal pay for female employees is now taking on the Walt Disney Company.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Andrus Anderson, which is based in San Francisco, filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Tuesday claiming that Disney discriminates against female workers by paying them less than their male counterparts. The complaint, filed on behalf of two employees at Walt Disney Studios, LaRonda Rasmussen and Karen Moore, asks for back pay, lost benefits and other compensation.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The plaintiffs also want a judge to force Disney to create internal programs to “remedy the effects of Disney’s past and present unlawful employment policies,” including adjusting salaries and benefits for other women and creating a task force that compiles reports on progress. Lori E. Andrus and Jennie Lee Anderson, lawyers representing the women, asked that the case be certified as a class action.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Women are fed up with being treated as cheap labor,” Ms. Andrus said, noting that Tuesday was
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.amny.com/news/equal-pay-day-explained-1.29260068" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  National Equal Pay Day
 </a>
 , the point in the year at which, on average, a woman’s pay for working in 2018 and 2019 would equal a man’s pay just for 2018. “We hope that this lawsuit will shed some light on the pay discrimination that Disney is subjecting its hard-working female employees to.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In a statement, Disney said, “The lawsuit is without merit and we will defend against it vigorously.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 On Wednesday, Disney added in a statement, “The lawsuit’s uninformed generalized allegations about Disney’s policies and practices are baseless. Disney maintains robust pay equity practices and policies. Even before California’s Fair Pay Act, Disney created a specialized team of compensation professionals and lawyers to analyze and address the company’s pay equity practices.”

  Labor Department is investigating
 </a>
 whether Google systematically underpays women, an accusation that the tech giant denies. (A recent study conducted by the company indicated that
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/technology/google-gender-pay-gap.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fdaisuke-wakabayashi&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=undefined&amp;region=stream&amp;module=inline&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=5&amp;pgtype=collection" title="">
  men were being underpaid
 </a>
 , though critics said that the research ignored broader questions of gender inequity.)

 Time’s Up, the Hollywood-led initiative to combat workplace harassment and inequality, said Monday that it had teamed with California lawmakers and

  equal pay pledge
 </a>
 .” So far, 13 companies have agreed, including two in the entertainment business: Apple and AT&amp;T, which owns WarnerMedia.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Britain has recently forced a reckoning about unequal pay by requiring companies to
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/business/britain-gender-pay-gap.html?module=inline" title="">
  publicly air their salary information
 </a>
 . Ms. Andrus noted that the statistics that Disney released in Britain, where it employs about 1,600 people, showed a
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://deadline.com/2018/03/men-earn-22-more-than-women-at-disney-as-hollywood-studio-publishes-gender-pay-statistics-1202356409/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  large disparity
 </a>
 between men and women. Disney said at the time that the data was misleading, noting that the company compensates and promotes employees “based on their roles, experience and performance.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ms. Rasmussen has worked at Disney for 11 years, most recently as a product development manager at Walt Disney Studios, according to the complaint filed on Tuesday. In 2017, she complained to Disney’s human resources department about being paid less than men performing the same or very similar jobs and asked for an audit, the lawsuit said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The audit found that men were paid more, but Disney told Ms. Rasmussen that the amount of her pay was “not due to gender.” In November 2018, Disney raised her annual salary by $25,000 and said the increase resulted from “an evaluation of market forces.” Even with the increase, Ms. Rasmussen asserts that she is paid less than male counterparts.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ms. Moore has worked for Disney for over two decades, the complaint said, and is a senior copyright administrator at the studio’s music label. Ms. Moore says that she was discouraged from applying for a manager position and that, after the job description was changed, a man was hired. He is “making significantly more than Ms. Moore even though they are both performing the same or substantially similar work,” according to the complaint.

 BURBANK, Calif. — The Walt Disney Company has been talking about plans to start a Netflix-style streaming service for two years. On Thursday came the big reveal.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 D-Day, as some in Hollywood called it.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In a lavish presentation on the Disney lot, Robert A. Iger, Disney’s chief executive, offered long-awaited details about his counterattack on the tech giants that have moved into the entertainment business. The linchpin is Disney Plus, a
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/05/business/media/disney-streaming-service-ricky-strauss.html?module=inline" title="">
  new subscription video service
 </a>
 dedicated to movies and shows from Disney, Pixar, the “Star Wars” franchise, National Geographic and Marvel.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Disney Plus will cost $7 a month and arrive on Nov. 12. (Netflix’s cheapest plan is $9, and its standard plan is $13.) Disney said it intended to roll out the streaming service in Europe and Asia starting next year. It expects subscribers to total 60 million to 90 million by 2024.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “We are all-in,” Mr. Iger said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In its first year, Disney Plus will offer 10 original films and 25 original series, including three “Avengers” spinoffs. Disney announced that all 30 seasons of “The Simpsons” would be available on Day One, along with nearly all the “Star Wars” movies, the entire Pixar library and family-focused movies and shows from its Fox library like “The Sound of Music” and “Malcolm in the Middle.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 To market Disney Plus, the company vowed to use the full reach of its empire as it has never done before, starting with a “Star Wars” fan convention in Chicago this weekend. Disney will also mobilize its cruise line, global theme parks, retail stores, hotels and television networks, including ESPN and ABC.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The presentation, inside Soundstage 2, home to the
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://d23.com/this-day/the-walt-disney-studios-is-rededicated/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  original “Mickey Mouse Club,”
 </a>
 began with a 14-minute sizzle reel highlighting Disney’s vast library, which now includes Fox movies like “Titanic,” “Avatar” and “Alien.” Mr. Iger called the library “a treasure trove of long-lasting, valuable content” that “no other content or technology company can rival.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. Iger added, “It was important to remind you that we’re starting from a position of strength, confidence and unbridled optimism.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The moment amounted to a turning point in the streaming wars. For the first time, a traditional media company demonstrated the firepower needed to compete with Silicon Valley in the fast-growing realm of online video.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Disney’s plans could have failed to impress, along the lines of what happened to Apple last month when it staged a similar event focused on its streaming ambitions. Apple
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/technology/apple-news-streaming-service.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fjohn-koblin&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=undefined&amp;region=stream&amp;module=inline&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=5&amp;pgtype=collection" title="">
  trotted out celebrities
 </a>
 but offered

  few specifics
 </a>
 — nothing on pricing, no launch date, barely any footage.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Disney has a mixed track record with technology, struggling to find a winning strategy with video games and failing to capitalize on tech-related
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/25/business/media/disney-buys-maker-studios-video-supplier-for-youtube.html?module=inline" title="">
  acquisitions like Maker
 </a>
 , a YouTube-based video supplier.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Unlike Apple, Disney unveiled footage from original shows and films that are headed to Disney Plus. One live-action series is called “The Mandalorian.” Set in the “Star Wars” universe and created by Jon Favreau, the show cost an estimated $100 million for 10 episodes, on a par with earlier seasons of HBO’s extravagant “Game of Thrones.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Disney also demonstrated the Disney Plus app. The simple user interface, with movie and television tiles arranged against a dark background, will look familiar to any Netflix, Amazon or Hulu user. There will be “recommended for you” rows of suggested shows and movies, as well as the option to “continue watching” programs.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 There will be tiles dedicated to the Disney brands, including Pixar, ‘Star Wars’ and National Geographic. Each time a user hovers over a brand tile, an animated image is set off — fireworks blasting behind the Magic Kingdom for the Disney tile or a comic book flip for Marvel.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Users can make a personalized avatar using characters from Disney’s intellectual property, including Buzz Lightyear and Moana.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 While the three-and-a-half-hour presentation’s target audience was Wall Street — analysts were invited to attend — the presentation was also aimed at potential Disney Plus subscribers. Disney also discussed its broader streaming business, which includes Hulu, ESPN Plus and Hotstar, which has 300 million monthly active users in India.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Disney will “likely” bundle its disparate services at a discounted price, according to Kevin Mayer, chairman of the company’s Direct-to-Consumer and International division. Mr. Mayer said that Disney was “actively evaluating” international strategies for Hulu, which currently operates exclusively in the United States. (Unlike Netflix.)
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Will Disney greatly expand Hulu’s budget? Randy Freer, the chief executive of Hulu, said it planned to expand original programs but did not say by how much.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 With Disney’s acquisition of much of 21st Century Fox, it now owns 60 percent of Hulu, giving the service a majority owner for the first time in its history. (The other companies with ownership stakes include Comcast, at 30 percent, and AT&amp;T’s Warner Media.) Hulu now has 25 million subscribers. Disney said it expected Hulu’s subscriber number to reach 40 million to 60 million in five years, and to be profitable by 2023 or 2024.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Most analysts have sky-high expectations for Disney Plus, which the company styles as Disney+.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Our confidence in the resilient success of Disney+ comes from the company’s unmatched brand recognition, extensive premium content and unparalleled ecosystem to market the service,” Alexia Quadrani, an analyst at J.P. Morgan, wrote in a recent report. Bank of Montreal and Cowen and Company both upgraded Disney’s stock ahead of Thursday’s presentation.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. Iger has spent years laying the groundwork for Disney Plus. In 2015, as Netflix grew at a blistering rate, Disney began experimenting overseas with an app called DisneyLife. Rolled out in Britain, DisneyLife offered old movies and television series, children’s e-books, games and music. Without new movies, or at least exclusive content, interest was limited.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 2016 Mr. Iger started talking more openly about needing to develop a streaming business — a risky proposition for a company with vast traditional television holdings. Disney paid $1 billion for a 33 percent stake in BamTech, a
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/08/business/media/bamtech-disney-streaming.html?module=inline" title="">
  streaming services company
 </a>
 , eventually paying $1.58 billion more for majority control.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. Iger announced in summer 2017 that Disney would
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/08/business/media/disney-streaming-service.html?module=inline" title="">
  introduce its own
 </a>
 Netflix-style service and stop selling movie rerun rights to Netflix, forgoing hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. In 2018 came Disney’s $71.3 billion purchase of 21st Century Fox assets, including National Geographic and the Fox movie studio. Mr. Iger positioned the acquisition as supercharging Disney’s move into streaming.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Michael Nathanson, a media analyst at MoffettNathanson, estimated in a report on Tuesday that Disney Plus could lose as much as $1.8 billion annually through 2023, with programming as one major expense. Add in losses from Hulu and ESPN Plus and Mr. Nathanson expects Disney’s streaming division to lose roughly $3.8 billion this year and next.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 At least nine new movies are in production or advanced development for Disney Plus, with budgets ranging from $20 million to $60 million. Disney is remaking two musicals from its animation library as live-action films: “Lady and the Tramp” (1955) and “The Sword in the Stone” (1963). Other new movies include “Togo,” a period adventure about a sled dog; “Noelle,” starring Anna Kendrick as Santa’s daughter; and an animated “Phineas and Ferb” movie.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Marvel Studios is working on three Disney Plus shows. One will focus on Loki from the “Avengers” movies, with Tom Hiddleston reprising the role. Another “Avengers” star, Elizabeth Olsen, will reprise her Scarlet Witch character in a second series. A third show will be associated with “Captain America: The Winter Soldier,” with Anthony Mackie returning as the Falcon.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Also in the works are episodic spinoffs of Disney franchises like “High School Musical” and “Monsters, Inc.” Additionally, Disney is working on 10 unscripted shows, including a Disney-themed cooking competition, “Be Our Chef,” and a series called “Encore!” that reunites the casts of high school musicals long after graduation and asks them to recreate their performance.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Roughly 500 films from Disney’s library, including new movies like “Captain Marvel,” and 7,500 episodes of old Disney-branded television shows like “Hannah Montana” will anchor Disney Plus.

 LOS ANGELES — Disney is taking back James Gunn, the creative force behind its “Guardians of the Galaxy” movie franchise, reversing its contentious decision in July to
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/20/business/media/james-gunn-fired-offensive-tweets.html?module=inline" title="">
  fire the filmmaker
 </a>
 for offensive jokes he wrote on Twitter several years ago.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The tweets by Mr. Gunn, who wrote and directed the Marvel superhero film “Guardians of the Galaxy” in 2014 and delivered a smash sequel in 2017, contained jokes about pedophilia, AIDS, rape and the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Two far-right provocateurs, Mike Cernovich and Jack Posobiec, threw a spotlight on the comments — written between 2009 and 2012 — after Mr. Gunn harshly criticized President Trump online.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Disney executives seemed to acknowledge on Friday that they made a misstep of their own in almost immediately firing Mr. Gunn in the aftermath: At the time, “Guardians” cast members
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/30/business/media/guardians-of-the-galaxy-support-james-gunn.html?module=inline" title="">
  condemned the decision
 </a>
 as an overreaction to the “mob mentality” of the internet. If nothing else, the reversal reflects the challenges that Hollywood studios face as they contend with online furors over past behavior in response to the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements, all while trying to protect billion-dollar film properties.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Walt Disney Studios
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://deadline.com/2019/03/james-gunn-reinstated-guardians-of-the-galaxy-3-disney-suicide-squad-2-indefensible-social-media-messages-1202576444/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  revealed
 </a>
 Mr. Gunn’s reinstatement as the director of “Guardians of the Galaxy 3” in an article on Deadline.com, a trade news site. Disney declined to comment further, except to confirm the report’s accuracy. In a statement on Twitter, Mr. Gunn called himself “incredibly humbled” and “tremendously grateful” to those who had supported him in recent months.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “I am always learning and will continue to work at being the best human being I can be,” he wrote. “I deeply appreciate Disney’s decision.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Alan F. Horn, chairman of Walt Disney Studios, decided to rehire Mr. Gunn — several months ago — after a series of meetings with the director. Mr. Horn, who reached out to Mr. Gunn, had been impressed with his public apology on the day Disney fired him. Mr. Gunn repeatedly took responsibility for his words, which he called “stupid, not at all funny, wildly insensitive and certainly not provocative like I had hoped.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Regardless of how much time has passed,” he had added, “I understand and accept the business decisions taken today.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. Gunn’s response stood in contrast to how other stars have reacted in similar situations. Kevin Hart, for instance, was initially defensive when his past
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/arts/kevin-hart-homophobic-tweets.html?module=inline" title="">
  anti-gay comments
 </a>
 on Twitter resurfaced in December after he was named host of the Academy Awards telecast. Mr. Hart did not apologize at first, instead posting a video online in which he said: “Guys, I’m almost 40 years old. If you don’t believe that people change, grow, evolve as they get older, I don’t know what to tell you.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Six hours later, he stepped down as Oscar host and offered a perfunctory apology.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was unclear to what degree Disney was influenced by blowback from “Guardians” fans over Mr. Gunn’s ouster. Hundreds of thousands of people signed a
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.change.org/p/marvel-re-hire-james-gunn" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Change.org petition
 </a>
 asking Disney to reconsider.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Guardians of the Galaxy” is a crucial property for Disney. The first two movies, starring Chris Pratt as Star-Lord and Zoe Saldana as Gamora, and featuring fan-favorite creatures like Groot and Rocket raccoon, collected roughly $1.6 billion at the global box office. Disney also sells “Guardians” merchandise and is counting on an expensive new “Guardians” attraction at Epcot in Florida to sell theme park vacations.
</p>

 In his live-action remake of Disney’s “Dumbo,” Tim Burton plays with a legacy that he has helped burnish for decades, only to set it gleefully ablaze. Ho-hum until it takes a turn toward the fascinatingly weird, the movie is a welcome declaration of artistic independence for Burton, who often strains against aesthetic and industrial restrictions. Watching him cut loose (more recklessly than his flying baby elephant) is by far the most unexpected pleasure of this movie, which dusts off the 1941 animated charmer with exhilaratingly demented spirit.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 One of Disney’s simplest, sweetest heart-tuggers (
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/31/fashion/31disney.html?module=inline" title="">
  with some queasy racial stereotypes
 </a>
 ), the original “Dumbo” tells the story of a wee circus elephant whose enormous flappy ears enable him to fly.
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/10/arts/helen-a-mayer-dumbo-s-creator-dies-at-91.html?module=inline" title="">
  Based on a children’s book
 </a>
 , it was made fast and proved a terrific success. The straightforward story might not have seemed an obvious choice for an auteurist project, particularly given this one’s cultivated eccentricities. But “Dumbo” is among the seemingly endless number of animated movies that Disney is giving a live-action makeover: “
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/15/movies/the-jungle-book-review.html?module=inline" title="">
  Jungle Book
 </a>
 ,” “The Lion King,” “Aladdin,” “Mulan,” “The Sword in the Stone,” and on and on until the end of the world (or movies) as we know it.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 For roughly the first half-hour of the new “Dumbo,” Burton seems on autopilot as he introduces the characters and sets the old-timey scene with an otherworldly pale palette. (The script is by Ehren Kruger, whose credits include “The Brothers Grimm” and several “Transformers” movies.) The story opens in 1919 at a down-and-out circus owned by Max Medici (Danny DeVito, pumping life into his scenes), a ringmaster who presides over the movie’s busily milling, child-friendly freaks and geeks. By the time an earnest, tamped-down Colin Farrell enters as Holt, a big-tent trick rider turned disabled World War I veteran, the near two-hour running time feels a lot like a threat.

 Things pick up when baby Dumbo arrives in a makeshift birthing bed. Now a digital cutie with gargantuan ears that hang off each side of his head like heavy leather curtains, the newest, littlest circus addition is conspicuously more animal than his childlike antecedent. Like the original, this Dumbo doesn’t speak, which perhaps is why Burton focuses on his unnaturally large, expressive eyes. (He’s an
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/indian-elephant" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Indian elephant
 </a>
 , so his trunk has one searching finger.) Those eyes moisten a lot, including when Holt’s drearily conceptualized and motherless — of course! — children (Nico Parker and Finley Hobbins) comfort Dumbo after his protective mom is sent to elephant jail.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In time, the kids help teach Dumbo to fly, coaxing him with a feather he snuffles into his trunk: He sneezes, and the exhalation sends him up. When he finally achieves genuine liftoff, soaring around the interior of the circus’s one-ring tent, Burton does, too. It’s ticklish fun to watch
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.sheldrickwildlifetrust.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  baby elephants
 </a>
 of any kind, including an airborne one. That’s true even if Dumbo’s flights prove increasingly bleak because he’s at the mercy of some very bad people. Humans are secondary attractions in the 1941 movie (its animals are people proxies) but they crowd the remake. Most are just generic placeholders, but a few are strikingly brutal exploiters, none more so than V. A. Vandevere, a subversive invention.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Played by Michael Keaton in full live-wire mode, Vandevere is a stereotypical Richie Rich screen villain with a shadowy lair; dark designs; a wolfish smile; and a silky, possibly fatal femme, Colette (Eva Green, who adds some steel filament to a bauble). Keaton makes the character more memorable than most anyone here; Vandevere seems ready to dangerously pop. What makes him particularly arresting, though, is that he owns a sprawling, impersonal amusement park named Dreamland that is filled with menace and with attractions — Nightmare Island, Wonders of Science, Rocket to the Future and
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/03/exotic-animals-ancient-rome/475704/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="the original">
  the ominously named Colosseum
 </a>
 — that suggest a Disneyland Bizarro World.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 At first, Dreamland seems like just another reflexive flourish in a film about a group of ragtag struggling entertainers rescued by a star. There are a lot of movies about movies, and the default is generally self-flattering even at its most cynical. Disney’s have long been de facto advertisements for the company’s even more profitable offscreen world; its animated “Hercules” actually features a Hercules Store with merch that mirrors the stuff sold offscreen. In “Dumbo,” Burton takes this self-referential impulse to a startling level through the representation of its Walt Disney-style impresario — who speaks of magic and mystique — and then by lighting the whole shebang on fire.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 By the time Holt is galloping through flames and Vandevere is threatening to kill Dumbo’s mom — matricide being a studio signature — the movie has gone enjoyably bonkers. The animals are roaring, the workers are revolting, and Burton has merrily turned what could have been another remake into something genuinely different and surprising. What exactly it is will partly depend on your view toward Disney. So it’s worth noting that for all the tumult and fury, this can also feel a bit like a bittersweet origin story: 1919 was the same year that the teenage Walt returned from war and was hired by a commercial art shop where he met

 , who helped create Mickey Mouse.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “They’re paying me to draw pictures,” Walt said, voicing the joy of creation that is too often missing in his company’s later movies but here burns with a vengeance.

 LOS ANGELES — “Everything the light touches is our kingdom.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s a line from Disney’s “The Lion King,” spoken by Mufasa to young Simba as they sit atop Pride Rock. And on Wednesday morning, just after midnight on the East Coast, it seemed to describe the Walt Disney Company itself, as the conglomerate closed its

 </a>
 of 21st Century Fox assets. It is now an entertainment colossus the size of which the world has never seen.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The ripple effects may not become clear for years. Analysts say that Disney could force smaller studios to merge as they scramble to compete. It will have greater leverage over theater owners when it comes to box office splits. And Disney’s plans to use Fox content to forcefully move into streaming could slow the growth of Netflix.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “This deal definitely reshapes the landscape,” said Michael Nathanson, a leading media analyst.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Disney now owns most of Rupert Murdoch’s former empire, including the 20th Century Fox movie and television studio, which includes the “X-Men,” “Avatar” and “Simpsons” franchises; Blue Sky, the
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/11/business/media/11bluesky.html?module=inline" title="">

 that is based in Connecticut; the National Geographic and FX cable networks; most of the streaming service Hulu; and Star, a fast-growing television-service provider in India.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Disney had been a mere behemoth, dominating sports television through ESPN, controlling the global theme park business and running Hollywood’s No. 1 movie operation, with studios that include Marvel, Pixar and Lucasfilm. But the company decided that it needed to bulk up even more as the tech giants aggressively moved into Hollywood. The competition now includes Apple, which is
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/17/business/media/apple-content-hollywood.html?module=inline" title="">
  scheduled to unveil
 </a>
 its television and movie plans on Monday.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “This is an extraordinary and historic moment for us,” Robert A. Iger, Disney’s chief executive, said in a statement on Tuesday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. Iger has
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/15/business/media/bob-iger-disney-fox.html?module=inline" title="">
  staked his legacy on this deal
 </a>
 , and he had to fend off an aggressive play by Comcast on two continents to gain control of Mr. Murdoch’s trove. (Mr. Iger ultimately
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/23/business/media/comcast-disney-sky.html?module=inline" title="">
  lost Sky
 </a>
 , the British pay-television company.) The acquisition is the largest in Disney’s 96-year history, dwarfing even the 1995
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/01/business/media-business-merger-walt-disney-acquire-abc-19-billion-deal-build-giant-for.html?module=inline" title="">
  purchase of Capital Cities / ABC.
 </a>
 That cost $19 billion (about $32 billion in today’s money) and, because it included ESPN, served as a growth engine for Disney for two decades.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Fox assets are meant to do the same for Disney in the years ahead. Disney is now trying to become less dependent on cable channels like ESPN, which are in slow, steady decline owing to cord-cutting. Instead, Disney has decided to move into the rapidly growing realm of online video, a direct-to-consumer business defined by Netflix. Mr. Iger believes that the Fox assets will enhance that plan, which includes a streaming service called
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/05/business/media/disney-streaming-service-ricky-strauss.html?module=inline" title="">
  Disney+ later this year
 </a>
 .
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “The pace of disruption has only hastened,” Mr. Iger told The New York Times in an interview when the deal was announced. “This will allow us to greatly accelerate our direct-to-consumer strategy, which is our highest priority.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The challenges are daunting. Mr. Iger and his lieutenants need to persuade investors to start viewing Disney more like a technology company, where near-term financial turbulence is often overlooked. Integrating the Fox assets will bring headaches that include substantial layoffs — analysts project more than 3,000 — and the melding of two starkly different corporate cultures. When the deal was announced in December 2017, James L. Brooks, a creator of “The Simpsons,”
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/canyonjim/status/941337024002383874" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 </a>
 that showed an angry Homer Simpson strangling Mickey Mouse.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 To win approval from antitrust regulators around the world, Disney had to agree to modest concessions.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It is already deep in the process of selling Fox’s 22 regional sports channels, a move required by the Justice Department. The Yankees teamed with Amazon this month, for instance, to buy the YES Network, which serves the New York metropolitan area, for
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/business/media/amazon-yankees-yes-network.html?module=inline" title="">
  roughly $3.5 billion
 </a>
 . To appease European regulators, Disney
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/ae-networks-disney-hearst-1203027693/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  agreed to divest
 </a>
 a stake in A+E Networks, which include the History channel. (Disney will retain 50 percent ownership of the division in the United States; Hearst owns the other half.)
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The final sticking points came from Brazil and Mexico. Regulators in those countries are forcing Disney to sell Fox Sports, a competitor to ESPN that holds extensive rights to televise soccer matches. Brazil’s antitrust regulator, Cade, said in a statement that operating both channels would give Disney too much control of the sports TV market in the country. Mexico’s telecommunications regulator, IFT, held a similar view and added stipulations about Disney’s ownership of the National Geographic and Nat Geo Wild channels.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 At Disney’s annual meeting this month, Mr. Iger said the 20th Century Fox and Fox Searchlight labels — trumpet fanfares included — would continue to exist. That decision pleased Hollywood, but it could lead to consumer confusion since Mr. Murdoch retained ownership of the Fox broadcast network, a chain of local Fox television stations and his crown jewel, Fox News. Those businesses, along with the FS1 sports channel, were rolled into a new publicly traded company, Fox Corporation, on Tuesday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Paul D. Ryan, the former Republican congressman from Wisconsin who served as speaker of the House from October 2015 to January 2019, joined the Fox board on Tuesday. Other board members include Mr. Murdoch and Roland A. Hernandez, a former chief executive of Telemundo. Mr. Murdoch’s oldest son, Lachlan, serves as the new company’s chief executive.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Murdochs are expected to receive

  roughly $12 billion
 </a>
 in proceeds from the Disney deal, according to Bloomberg. Shareholders in the assets that were sold to Disney had the option to accept Disney shares or cash out. Disney said on Friday that, based on initial results of that process, holders of about 52 percent of shares asked for cash and 37 percent asked for Disney shares. The balance did not make a request.

 One audience reviewer deemed the movie “a complete disaster.” Another was “tired of all this SJW nonsense,” using the abbreviation for “social justice warrior,” a pejorative term for progressives. Yet another groused that Brie Larson, the movie’s star, “says I shouldn’t see the movie anyway.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Captain Marvel” had not even been released yet — its opening day was a month away — but that did not stop negative remarks from piling up against the film and Ms. Larson.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Much as Facebook and Twitter have had to grapple with false stories aimed at inciting violence or disrupting elections, movie review aggregators like Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb are often besieged by users trying to manipulate a film’s box office success.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Despite the trolls’ concerted efforts, “Captain Marvel” slayed during its opening weekend, but not before Rotten Tomatoes, an influential site where a bad audience score can damage a film’s prospects, made major changes to its rules. Most critically, it eliminated prerelease audience reviews. It also stopped displaying the percentage of moviegoers who say they “want to see” a film in favor of using the raw number of people. And it removed the “not interested” button.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “We’re doing it to more accurately and authentically represent the voice of fans,” the site said, “while protecting our data and public forums from bad actors.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The backlash against “Captain Marvel” resulted from a collision of two major forces. One was the popularity of websites that at their best democratize the reviewing of movies, restaurants and businesses and at their worst can be weaponized for score-settling or political grudges.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The other was the growing movement in Hollywood toward broader gender and racial representation in film roles, production jobs and the industry in general.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Captain Marvel” is among the few superhero films to star a woman, but a bigger trigger factor for the film’s haters appeared to be Ms. Larson’s outspokenness about the lack of diversity in movies and news media coverage of films.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Before the film’s release, Ms. Larson told “Entertainment Tonight” that she had spoken with Marvel about making the film “a big feminist movie.” In another interview, she said that after noticing that most of her interviewers in the past had been white and male, she vowed to seek out more underrepresented journalists, including
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://keahbrown.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Keah Brown
 </a>
 , who is black and disabled, and who profiled her for Marie Claire.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ms. Larson, who won the best-actress Oscar in 2016 for her performance in “Room,” had previously lashed out against the homogeneity of professional film critics. “I do not need a 40-year-old white dude to tell me what didn’t work for him about ‘A Wrinkle in Time,’” she said during a speech last summer. “It wasn’t made for him.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This all provided fodder to trolls, and weeks ahead of “Captain Marvel’s” release, the percentage of Rotten Tomatoes users who registered that they wanted to see it plummeted to 27 percent. On Feb. 25, Rotten Tomatoes implemented the changes, and the “want to see” score disappeared. Since the film’s nationwide release on Friday, the audience score has rebounded to a better-but-still-not-great 63 percent,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/franchise/marvel_cinematic_universe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  the lowest
 </a>
 for any movie in the Marvel franchise. For a while, the score had been below 60 percent, signified by a tipped-over bucket of popcorn, the symbol for a film that might be one to skip.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The “Tomatometer,” which analyzes the ratings from film critics, is at a “certified fresh” 79 percent, slightly below the average for Marvel movies. It is impossible to say whether the website’s changes helped the film, but it made $456 million during its opening weekend, trouncing projections.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 A representative for Ms. Larson declined to comment, and publicists at Disney, which owns Marvel Studios, did not reply to emails Tuesday.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The film’s opponents also swarmed YouTube; video rants with titles like “Brie Larson is Ruining Marvel” often appeared at the top of searches for her name. But a day before the film’s release, a change in the search results pushed those videos beneath others from established sources like Jimmy Kimmel, “Today” and Wired.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 A YouTube representative said the reason was an algorithm change made last summer that reclassifies trending search topics as news. The site, which is owned by Google, took the action as part of its effort to combat fictitious content and ensure that reliable information was highlighted.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Captain Marvel” detractors also flocked to IMDb, though a representative from that site said no one was available to comment, and would only provide
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://help.imdb.com/article/imdb/track-movies-tv/faq-for-imdb-ratings/G67Y87TFYYP6TWAV" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  a link
 </a>
 to the site’s ratings and comments policy, which states that users are not allowed to rate a film before its release.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The new Marvel movie is not the first film to come under attack for a perceived feminist or politically correct underpinning. The all-female remake of “Ghostbusters,” “Black Panther” and “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” which had a diverse cast, all found themselves in the cross hairs of armchair critics, some aligned with alt-right groups.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Some sites pushed back. Last year, Rotten Tomatoes said it would delete comments posted from members of the Facebook group “Down with Disney’s Treatment of Franchises and Its Fanboys” if they contained hate speech. The group had posted an event called “Give Black Panther a Rotten Audience Score on Rotten Tomatoes.” Facebook then deactivated the group (it has since been revived by someone claiming to be anti-troll), which had also
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2305232/person-who-says-they-rigged-the-last-jedis-rotten-tomatoes-score-is-trying-to-do-the-same-with-black-panther" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  claimed responsibility
 </a>
 for torpedoing audience scores for “Star Wars: The Last Jedi.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 That a movie starring Ms. Larson spurred Rotten Tomatoes into taking a bolder step was no coincidence.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When Ms. Larson spoke out last summer against the dominance of white male critics, she cited findings by the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, which is run out of the University of Southern California and had singled out Rotten Tomatoes for having 3.5 men to every female critic reviewing the top films of 2017.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In her speech, Ms. Larson also
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.indiewire.com/2018/06/tiff-media-diversity-sundance-underrepresented-journalists-1201974849/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  revealed
 </a>
 that the Sundance and Toronto film festivals had each pledged to set aside one-fifth of their press passes for use by diverse journalists, including women and people of color.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Two and a half months later, Rotten Tomatoes threw in with Ms. Larson’s cause, and
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/28/business/media/rotten-tomatoes-critics.html?module=inline" title="">
  revamped its criteria
 </a>
 for critics, focusing more on individual qualifications than the brand and reach of a publication, to include hundreds of reviewers from underrepresented groups in its Tomatometer score (a representative said the change had been in development for over a year). It also
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://variety.com/2018/film/festivals/rotten-tomatoes-donates-sundance-inclusion-initiative-underrepresented-film-critics-1203039590/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  pledged $100,000
 </a>
 to various film festivals working to diversify their press corps, in part by helping cover freelancers’ travel and lodging costs.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 A representative for
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Rotten Tomatoes
 </a>
 , Dana Benson, said the change to its audience score had been in the works for a while, but that the attacks on “Captain Marvel” prompted them to roll it out earlier than planned.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “We’re very dedicated to making criticism more inclusive,” Ms. Benson said. “All the thought and care that went into the Tomatometer, we are expanding that to the audience score.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Rotten Tomatoes said future changes could include having “verified” reviewers, like the ones who post on Amazon after purchasing a product. Those could come from people who bought tickets through Fandango, the movie ticket website, which owns Rotten Tomatoes.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 There was, not unexpectedly, a flip side to the attacks on “Captain Marvel” — people rushing to its defense, whether they had seen the movie or not.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “There are a large group of people that are only down-voting this movie because they somehow feel threatened by it,” wrote one fan on Rotten Tomatoes.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Imagine being so insecure, you cry about a movie with a girl as the hero,” wrote another.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And over on IMDb, one wrote: “I do agree that this isn’t marvel’s best movie, but it was a fun and enjoyable ride. I’m sure director and co. were hyper aware of the backlash they were facing and some of the moments seemed like tongue-in-cheek middle fingers to all the hate.”

 At the “Captain Marvel” premiere in Los Angeles last month, Brie Larson
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBpsHfN-Ty0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 </a>
 in a sequined Rodarte slip dress, a galaxy of diamonds cradling her ears. A squadron of F-16 fighter jets flew overhead as fans cheered the movie’s star as she climbed steps to a stage where she was interviewed by Lorraine Cink.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ms. Cink, a self-described comic book geek and red carpet host, did not ask Ms. Larson about her gown as others did that day. Nor did she discuss
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://time.com/5403533/brie-larson-captain-marvel-smile/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 </a>
 in Hollywood. Instead she focused solely on Captain Marvel and her alter ego Carol Danvers, a United States Air Force pilot, played by Ms. Larson.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Carol changed my life and this movie hasn’t even come out yet,” Ms. Larson said, as she held back tears.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Red carpet interviews from the premiere were
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8reT9_rMmI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  streamed live for fans
 </a>
 who could not attend. And the show was as slickly produced as any pre-awards festivities, albeit one that edged toward camp at times. (For starters, Ms. Cink’s co-host
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.marvel.com/watch/digital-series/marvel-live/goose-the-cat-gets-ready-for-the-captain-marvel-red-carpet" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

  several that played Goose
 </a>
 in the movie.)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ms. Cink is an employee of Marvel Studios, which produced Captain Marvel. And if there is any question why the studio would air the red carpet live, consider this: The live stream has been watched more than 485,000 times on YouTube alone.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Fans today clamor for anything related to their favorite movies and television franchises. As a result, live-streaming from the red carpet is not just for the Oscars anymore. More studios are producing their own red carpet extravaganzas, hiring battalions of brand-friendly hosts to market the studio’s offerings and control social media messaging. And with technology that makes live-steaming easy, new players have joined the fray to take advantage of the summer blockbuster season and its worldwide audience.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Movie premieres have become global moments,” said Doug Neil, Universal Pictures executive vice president for digital marketing. “Fans like to feel like they are part of the experience.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. Neil would know. Last year the studio held only one premiere in London for “Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again.” With an army of Academy Award winners on the red carpet — including Meryl Streep, Colin Firth, Tom Hanks and Cher — the event would be difficult for Universal to reproduce elsewhere, he said. Premieres are expensive, too, sometimes costing $100,000 or more. So
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.facebook.com/MammaMiaMovie/videos/10155481261222665/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  the festivities in London were live-streamed
 </a>
 on Facebook, where they were viewed more than 451,000 times around the world.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “The talent bench was so deep,” Mr. Neil said of the celebrities who attended. “And Facebook has our largest community of fans.” With streaming technology, he added, “It’s very easy to flip a switch.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The quality, though, can depend on whose hand is on the switch. “When we started doing this, it was iPhones on tripods,” said Alison Hoffman, chief marketing officer for the cable channel Starz. Now, she said, the company teams up with media outlets, like Entertainment Weekly, People and Entertainment Tonight, to host live stream red carpet events. That was the case last June at the premiere of “Power” at Radio City Music Hall in Manhattan. The channel
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.facebook.com/Power.Starz/videos/1953785251341056/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  broadcast a live stream
 </a>
 with three video cameras.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “For the right show, it’s a critical part of the mix,” Ms. Hoffman said.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 That is not always the case, though. Last week, the cast of “Game of Thrones” gathered at Radio City Music Hall for the final red carpet premiere for the beloved HBO show. The spectacle was
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDecnF7kR2I" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  broadcast live
 </a>
 by NowThis, a social media content company, which streamed unscripted, raw footage from the “Game of Thrones” press line. An HBO executive said the company was neither involved in nor aware of the live stream, which explains why it had none of the polish of a typical HBO affair.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Photographers could be heard booing when Sophie Turner, who plays Sansa Stark, invited Joe Jonas, her pop star fiancé, to join her on the red carpet. “How about a kiss?” a man shouted at Lisa Bonet, the wife of Jason Momoa, who delighted as the he-man Khal Drogo in Season 1. Ms. Bonet shook her head no; her husband was visibly annoyed.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The video itself was sketchy, too. The camera shook and the Wi-Fi was unreliable. Gwendoline Christie looked fetching in a flowing yellow gown until she waved her silken sleeves and the screen disappeared into a haze of pixelated squares. Still, the live stream has been watched more than 188,000 times on YouTube.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “It’s not always the best quality that gets the most eyeballs,” said Tina Exarhos, the chief content officer of NowThis. “When you are on a red carpet, these are the moments you look for.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Despite the video’s raw quality, she added, “We are looking to do more and more of these with studios.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Walt Disney Studios, which oversees Lucasfilm, Marvel Studios, Pixar and its own slate of movies, has the most sophisticated live-streaming operation in Hollywood. Lylle Breier, who oversees premieres and special events for the studio, said there were often multiple hosts — some on stages, others on the red carpet — and several cameras used for interviews.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The movies that attract the most attention are the “Star Wars” and Marvel franchises. Last April’s red carpet premiere for “Avengers: Infinity War,” for example,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=5208&amp;v=gbRijjvIeyk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  has been watched 7.28 million times
 </a>
 . There, Gwyneth Paltrow plugged her company, Goop. (“She did a Goop detox and she’s fine,” she said of her stressed-out character, Pepper Potts.) Ms. Paltrow also admitted to never having watched an “Avengers” movie.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 As many as 30 people are hired to produce a live-streamed red carpet show for a Disney company premiere. And hosts, like Ms. Cink, have jobs mostly because they are fans. “They do not ask reporter-type questions,” Ms. Breier said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Ms. Cink has hosted at least six streaming red carpet premieres and writes all her own questions. She copped to being flustered by only one celebrity: Stan Lee, the force behind Marvel Comics. (Mr. Lee
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/obituaries/stan-lee-dead.html?module=inline" title="">
  died in November
 </a>
 , and “Captain Marvel” carries a dedication to him, as well as a montage of his movie cameos in the Marvel logo.)
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Her background in improvisational theater is helpful, she said. Once her earpiece quit working during a live shot, which made it impossible to hear.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “I looked like a deer in the headlights,” she said. “I screamed my intro. I know I looked, like, cuckoo bananas. And it was completely live. I was kicking off the whole show.”

 For a breakout star, it was a fairly mundane audition. To cast the part of Goose, an orange tabby who plays a critical role, the makers of “Captain Marvel” were meeting different cats, including Ursula Brauner’s Reggie. “We walked into a roomful of people, and I brought a big plush bed and set it on the table,” Brauner recalled. “Reggie hung out on the bed and was as chill as any cat could be, and the filmmakers saw him embody the character then and there. That’s how he got the job.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Captain Marvel” earned more than $500 million worldwide in its first week of release, in no small part thanks to Reggie and three fellow felines who steal scenes as the stray who is revealed to be a ferocious alien known as a Flerken. (In the

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Although special effects were involved, the actual animals are onscreen a fair amount, but at first it was going to be just Reggie. “After looking at the script and seeing the work required, we all decided it would be good to add a couple more cats to the team,” said Brauner, whose company, Animals for Hollywood, provides and trains nonhuman actors for films. In addition to Reggie and another experienced animal actor, Archie (yes, they’re named after Archie Comics characters), Brauner found two more orange tabbies, named Gonzo and Rizzo in a nod to the Muppets, at a shelter.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Each one had a specialty. “Reggie was our all-around go-to cat — he’s seen in most of the film,” Brauner said. “Archie is really rambunctious and loves to play, so we used him for the scratching scene.” The movie, set in 1995, depicts the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) suffering a cat-related injury, necessitating his signature eye-patch. (The comics’ explanation that he lost an eye in World War II didn’t jibe with the movie’s timeline.)
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Gonzo was mostly for holding in the scenes when Goose is carried,” Brauner continued. “And Rizzo was the master of all trades — we trained him in a little bit of everything, so he could step in if we needed backup.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 How do you train notoriously finicky cats? Brauner said the process was not as tough as you might think. “Cats can be just as smart, lovable and easy to train as any dog,” she said. “It’s all positive reinforcement. We use food and treats, and there are different levels. We save the real good, hot stuff for when something’s a little harder or we’re further away from the cat on the set, just to make it worth their while.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Verbal commands and clickers were also used. “When they’ve done something right, the sound of the clicker is like an instant ‘Yes!’” Brauner explained. “They look forward to that, because they know a pet or a little piece of chicken or liver is coming.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The cats also eagerly anticipated interacting with their two-legged co-stars. “Sam always gave them treats,” Brauner said. “Every time they saw Sam, it was like, ‘Oh, I remember you!’”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And even though Ben Mendelsohn plays an alien who fears Flerkens, he couldn’t resist cozying up to the cats either. “His costume was a challenge, because he looked so different from a normal person,” said Brauner, who was given one of the character’s prosthetics-heavy suits to use in training. Once shooting began, “Ben would always take the opportunity to hang out with the cats and make them feel comfortable, and they really needed that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 What about Brie Larson, who stars as the titular superheroine? “She has an allergy, but it never affected us or the cats,” Brauner said. “She was wonderful and always open to helping us, and I really respected her for that.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Even after four months of pre-production training, the cats couldn’t perform some actions that Flerkens can, like shooting tentacles from their mouths. “That’s when special effects came in,” Brauner said. “Sometimes, like in the jet when the G-force is pushing Goose back, that was computer-generated, but a lot of it was Reggie, no C.G. needed. The filmmakers did as much as they could just with him.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Brauner said the most difficult part of her job was “getting the cats used to working on a chaotic movie set.” That’s also why Reggie didn’t actually attend the film’s premiere, although separate shots were taken of him wearing a tiny tie on the red carpet: “We try to make sure we don’t bring him out in public where something could go wrong, like a loud noise.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Still, should they be asked to return in any future Marvel movies — or shorts for a streaming service — Brauner said Reggie and the gang are ready for action. “I truly don’t know if that will happen,” she said. “We’re always up for that kind of challenge.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Goose’s popularity “surprised us as much as anybody,” Brauner said. “But a lot of it is Reggie — his charisma absolutely shines through.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Brauner said fame hadn’t changed the cats. “We try to keep them grounded,” she joked. “We’re good parents and make sure it doesn’t go to their heads.”

 DC Comics’s latest superhero spectacle,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/movies/shazam-review.html?module=inline" title="">
  “Shazam!
 </a>
 ,” which opens this weekend, follows the comedic adventures of Billy Batson (Asher Angel), a teenage boy who transforms into an adult superhero called Shazam (Zachary Levi). A buff, lightning-bolt-emblazoned man-boy, Shazam isn’t as well-known now as he used to be. But he is one of the most important heroes in comic history.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Shazam first appeared in Whiz Comics No. 2 in 1939, quickly becoming one of the most popular comic book characters of the 1940s. In his prime, he regularly outsold Superman and Batman. And he was the first comic book superhero to appear on film.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Back then, however, he went by the name Captain Marvel, which is a bit confusing, particularly given the debut of Marvel’s “
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/movies/captain-marvel-review.html?module=inline" title="">
  Captain Marvel

 ” last month. That may also help explain why Shazam feels a bit unfamiliar today.

</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Early box office predictions indicate that may be changing. Still, who is this guy? And what’s with the Captain Marvel thing? Here’s a primer on Shazam’s history.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1939, Fawcett Comics was looking to capitalize on the superhero boom created by characters like Superman. The writer Bill Parker came up with the idea of a team of superheroes, each of whom possessed the power of a different mythological figure. The idea was ultimately revised to just one character with all of those powers, and thus was born Shazam.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Parker originally called him Captain Thunder, but that name was already trademarked, so he switched to Captain Marvel. (A competitor, Timely Comics, did not rebrand as Marvel Comics until 1961.) The artist C.C. Beck was the illustrator, and he continued to draw Captain Marvel throughout the 1940s.

</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In his first appearance, Billy is an orphaned paperboy who meets a wizard in a mysterious subway station. After learning about Billy’s sad life, the wizard declares that he is too old to keep fighting crime and asks Billy to take his place. He endows Billy with the power to turn into Captain Marvel any time he says the word “Shazam,” which is an acronym for the “immortal elders” who give him his powers: Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles and Mercury.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The fact that Captain Marvel was secretly a kid made him a favorite among young readers. “Whiz Comics” No. 2 sold 500,000 copies, and the character’s own series, “Captain Marvel Adventures,” first came out in 1941, the same year he made his big screen debut.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 That film debut, in March 1941, was the 12-part live-action Republic Pictures serial “Adventures of Captain Marvel.” It is considered the first comic book superhero film, and it beat the first animated Superman cartoons to the big screen by six months.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In that version, Billy is a young explorer on an expedition to Siam, where he encounters the wizard. As Captain Marvel, he is tasked with protecting the world from the Golden Scorpion, an ancient and dangerous device sought by scientists and criminals. “Adventures of Captain Marvel” feels somewhat primitive and surprisingly violent by today’s superhero standards (Captain Marvel kills a lot of people), but it’s worth viewing to see how far the genre has come.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1951, National Comics Publications successfully argued that Captain Marvel was a copyright infringement on Superman because of their similar powers, costumes and artwork, signaling an end to a legal battle that began a decade earlier. (National had even tried to block the release of “Adventures of Captain Marvel.”) Fawcett paid National $400,000 in damages and was forced to cancel all of its superhero publications. No new Captain Marvel comics were produced for the next 22 years.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 1972, DC Comics acquired the rights to Fawcett’s characters and began producing new Captain Marvel stories the next year. Marvel Comics, however, had meanwhile trademarked the name,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/movies/captain-marvel-history.html?module=inline" title="">
  creating its own Captain Marvel in 1967
 </a>
 . DC was permitted to call its superhero Captain Marvel, but it was not allowed to use the name on any marketing or titles featuring the character. DC decided to sell its Captain Marvel books under the title “Shazam!”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 A children’s television series based on DC’s Captain Marvel, titled “Shazam!,” debuted on CBS in 1974. In the series, Billy (Michael Gray) travels around the country in a motor home with an adult companion (Les Tremayne) solving problems each week by turning into Captain Marvel (played by Jackson Bostwick and later John Davey). The show had a very low budget, so Captain Marvel appeared only very briefly in each episode.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The show lasted three seasons. A short-lived animated series featuring Captain Marvel, called “The Kid Super Power Hour With Shazam!” followed in 1981, and lasted 12 episodes, but that was his last starring role for a while.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Through the 1980s and ’90s, DC further integrated Captain Marvel into its comic universe, giving the character appearances in “Justice League,” “Kingdom Come” and his own continuing series, “The Power of Shazam!,” which lasted from 1995 to 1999. He returned to television in a 2005 episode of “Justice League Unlimited.” Playing on the fraught history between Captain Marvel and Superman, the character is introduced as a big fan of Superman, but the two heroes eventually come to blows.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The episode includes a fun Easter egg for comic book fans, as Captain Marvel’s hometown is named Fawcett City after his original publisher. Captain Marvel also makes several appearances in the Cartoon Network series “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and in several of DC’s direct-to-video animated films.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 2011, DC Comics relaunched all its comics with the New 52 initiative. New 52 was an attempt to simplify decades of complicated comic book history, and Captain Marvel received an updated origin story by the writer Geoff Johns, along with an official name change to Shazam.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The new “Shazam!” film incorporates multiple elements of the back story introduced by Johns. In 2018, DC debuted a new “Shazam!” comic book, the character’s first continuing series in nearly 20 years. Shazam may never again overtake Superman in popularity, but the box office and critical success of the new film should ensure that a whole new generation will know his name.

 Jordan Peele is holding a new mirror up to society, and this weekend proved just how many moviegoers want a look at its reflection.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Universal’s “Us,” the latest politically resonant horror movie from Peele, sold an estimated $70.3 million in tickets over the weekend, easily leading the domestic box office and more than doubling the

 The promise of Peele’s scares-with-a-message was more than enough to deliver “Us” the No. 1 spot. It unseated Disney’s “Captain Marvel,” which landed in second place with about $35 million in its third weekend, according to Comscore, which compiles box-office data.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both “Us” and “Captain Marvel” are diverse movies, with the former led by black actors and a black director and the latter starring a female superhero, the first Marvel Cinematic Universe film to do so.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Third place went to Paramount’s animated “Wonder Park,” which sold $9 million in tickets. And CBS Films and Lionsgate’s romantic drama “Five Feet Apart” came in a close fourth, with about $8.8 million. Both of those movies were in their second weekends.

 , the DC cinematic super-universe has been as somber as a grave. There have been exceptions, shimmers of light amid the doom. Outside the animated realm, though, the stories and mood have been downbeat, matched by hues that range from drab to black amid bilious green, raging purple and watery blue. Even the “S” on Superman’s chest looks drained of cheer, more like dried blood than some candy-colored delight.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Given this, the bright, popping red of the superhero costume in “Shazam!” is an early warning sign, as obvious as a matador’s cape, that the dreary and crepuscular have given way to something less self-serious and end-of-the-world grim. It’s a nice change of pace for a big-screen mega-comic, if not a revolutionary shift. There are still a lot of brand shilling and the usual tediously overextended fights, ka-pow and ka-boom. But these are delivered via Shazam, a charmingly breezy avenger in tights once known as Captain Marvel, a.k.a. the World’s Mightiest Mortal, or as I thought of him going in:
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  Who
 </em>
 ?
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The answer emerges piecemeal in “Shazam!,” another movie about a superhero with dual-identity issues. Here, the divided self begins with Billy (Asher Angel, a relaxed, natural presence), a foundling with pluck, heart and a sob story. He’s on a mission to find his mother (longish story), a journey that — as sometimes happens in male quests — leads him to a surrogate father. This one is an ancient wizard called, ta-da, Wizard (Djimon Hounsou in a comic Halloween-ish get-up), who passes his magic to Billy. Once back in his normal realm, Billy discovers that he can tap great powers by saying the word “shazam,” which turns him into a hero with an adult body (Zachary Levi).
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 If this sounds familiar — the Moses-like savior who learns he’s meant for greatness — it’s because the character was conceived to compete with Superman. Yet because Shazam isn’t as well known as Supes et al., he’s not as weighed down with fan expectations, the fate of the world and auteurist aspirations. The filmmakers (Henry Gayden wrote the script, David F. Sandberg directed) adhere to the heroic template, which means there’s a regulation villain (the reliably watchable Mark Strong) with schemes. But they also fill in the faces and places, and add enough shading and color to Billy’s world that when his inevitable fight against evil happens it feels as if something more than the box office is at stake.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Of course a franchise may be at stake, though considering how often the movie name drops Batman and Superman, it can’t help but feel as if the entire DC movie world is on the line. And maybe Shazam is a risk, just because he’s an unfamiliar avenger in a wildly overcrowded field. Created in 1939, the character was originally called Captain Marvel (and physically modeled on the actor Fred MacMurray). But for legal reasons, Captain Marvel went into storage only to be later resurrected by DC as Shazam. (DC’s longtime foe, Marvel Comics,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/03/captain-marvel-shazam-carol-danvers-guide" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="more">
  managed to trademark
 </a>
 the character’s first name for the avenger currently played by Brie Larson in “Captain Marvel.”)
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The new movie quickly dusts off the Shazam story, first by grounding it in Billy, a sweet, if somewhat melancholic mischief maker who soon becomes an appealing protagonist. The opening scene involving a couple of dimwit cops feels as ancient as a
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/02/arts/huntz-hall-perpetual-youth-in-bowery-films-dies-at-78.html?module=inline" title="">
  Bowery Boys movie
 </a>
 , perhaps intentionally. Things soon settle into an easy, everyday groove when Billy moves into a new foster home, a sprawl populated by kids (Jack Dylan Grazer, among them) who are generally cute instead of cutesy. Tenderly overseen by Rosa and Victor (Marta Milans and Cooper Andrews), the house has a lived-in coziness, a warmth and security that feels as unforced as the mix of ethnicities and races.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Once Billy says that magic word and his supersized alter ego appears, the movie goes to its happy place and comfortably embraces its own identity as a light, jocular, modest entertainment. Levi is best known for his television roles (

 ), but he easily scales up for the big screen. He can look like a beefier, tougher

  John Krasinski
 </a>
 ; as Shazam, though, Levi is pure cartoon, from his bootblacked helmet of hair to his tumescent musculature. Ken-doll plastic and handsome, he is an ideal, suitably absurd figure on which to hang an old-fashioned hero with a satiny high-collared cape and a fat yellow arrow suggestively pointing down.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The arrow is a winking joke and as subtle as the nod to the
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/03/movies/review-film-tom-hanks-as-a-13-year-old-in-big.html?module=inline" title="a review">
  Tom Hanks body-swapping comedy “Big.”
 </a>
 It’s also a reminder of Billy’s larger human journey, a metamorphosis that remains humorously, identifiably awkward, even as he wills his inner super-adult to heroic life. Angel’s performance lays the groundwork for the character — and keeps him tethered to reality — while Levi lifts Shazam up with an exuberant turn that conveys the delight of Billy’s extreme transformation as well as its lingering adolescent ungainliness and excess. It’s one thing to fight evil, but Shazam’s eye-popping, slack-jawed, discordant physicality is a reminder that it’s just as tough to get a grip on yourself.
</p><p class="css-1e7dx92 evys1bk0">
 An earlier version of this review misidentified the character that once earned fans like Elvis Presley. It was Captain Marvel Jr., not Captain Marvel.

The first episode introduces Murphy and her roommate, Jess (Brooke Markham), while setting up the pieces for the mystery: the possible murder of Murphy’s teenage friend, Tyson (Thamela Mpumlwana). While out for a walk, Murphy discovers what she believes to be Tyson’s body, but the police doubt her story; for one thing, the body is gone by the time the police arrive.

 LOS ANGELES — Warner Bros. has finally earned back the benefit of the doubt when it comes to its all-important superhero movies: “Shazam!” became the studio’s third nonsequel comic-book hit in a row over the weekend, arriving to

 “We really want these movies to stand on their own, with filmmakers best suited to the characters,” Toby Emmerich, chairman of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group, said by phone on Sunday morning. “We’re all feeling deservedly really good.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Shazam!” was the No. 1 movie in North America, collecting $53.5 million over the weekend, according to Comscore, which compiles box-office data.

 Second place at the domestic box office went to a remake of “Pet Sematary” (Paramount), based on the novel by Stephen King. It took in an estimated $25 million. Disney’s big-budget “Dumbo” trundled along in third place, selling $18.2 million in tickets, for a sad two-week total of $76.3 million.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Shazam!” was made by New Line, a division of Warner that focuses on lower-cost films that often serve as counterprogramming.

</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “New Line always thought that ‘Big’ as a superhero movie was a great idea, a way to make the genre feel fresh and different,” Emmerich said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Warner has spent the better part of a decade trying to get its act together with movies based on characters from its DC Comics division — an imperative given the runaway success of rival Marvel Studios and the film industry’s increasing need for spectacles that audiences see as worth a trip to theaters. Part of the problem was that Warner stuck for too long with a dark vision for its superhero universe, set by the filmmaker Zack Snyder, that was
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://variety.com/2017/film/news/dc-films-justice-league-1202632214/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

 </a>
 . That led to creative and financial messes like “Suicide Squad” and “Justice League.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But the studio, having largely jettisoned Snyder’s plans and shaken up its executive ranks, including

 , has started to deliver superhero home runs on a consistent basis: “Wonder Woman” from Patty Jenkins, “Aquaman” from James Wan, and seemingly “Shazam!,” which was directed by a relative newcomer, David F. Sandberg.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Where the PG-13 “Shazam!” will end up at the box office remains a bit of a question mark given the impending arrival of “Avengers: Endgame.” Ticket buyers gave “Shazam!” an A grade in CinemaScore exit polls, an indication of staying power.

 SAN FRANCISCO — Shares of Netflix jumped 3 percent on Tuesday ahead of the streaming video service's quarterly results, with traders expecting a larger than normal reaction from the stock as new competition looms from Walt Disney Co.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Netflix will be the first to report March-quarter earnings among major high-growth firms and Wall Street's reaction to its results will be viewed as an indicator of what to expect when Amazon.com Inc and Facebook Inc report next week.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "There is some concern that real competition is entering the market, but Netflix is still a good proxy for investor risk appetite, especially for technology," said Joel Kulina, Senior Vice President of Institutional Cash Equities at Wedbush Securities.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Options traders expect Netflix shares to swing by about 7% in either direction in the session after its report, which is expected after the market closes on Tuesday. That is more than the median move of 5.4% in Netflix's eight most recent quarterly reports, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 On Jan. 18 following its last quarterly results, Netflix dropped 4% over concerns about slowing growth, and investors are now focused on how Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings plans to fend off a major challenge from Walt Disney, with its upcoming Disney+ streaming service.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 (GRAPHIC: Walt Disney mounts a challenge to Netflix - https://tmsnrt.rs/2VN8dcL)
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Disney's stock has surged 12% since it unveiled the service last week, which will be priced below Netflix and include some of the world's most popular entertainment franchises. Netflix has slipped almost 3% during that time.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "The real question that investors will want answered is how will the company launch a counterattack to Disney's massive offensive that is on the horizon?," Jones Trading Chief Market Strategist Mike O'Rourke wrote in a client note.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The so-called FANG group of high-growth stocks, including Facebook, Netflix, Google-parent Alphabet and Amazon, has rebounded sharply following a steep market selloff late last year. Facebook is up 36% year to date, followed by Netflix's 34% rise. Facebook reports on April 24, Amazon reports on April 25 and Alphabet Inc reports on April 29.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 For the first quarter, Netflix has said https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/quarterly_reports/2018/q4/01/FINAL-Q4-18-Shareholder-Letter.pdf it expects to add 8.9 million global subscribers.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Analysts on average expect Netflix to report a 21.6% rise in quarterly revenue to $4.5 billion, which would be its most modest quarterly revenue increase since 2013, according to Refinitiv. Analysts on average expect non-GAAP earnings per share of 57 cents.

 Astronomers announced on Wednesday that at last they had captured an image of the unobservable: a black hole, a cosmic abyss so deep and dense that not even light can escape it.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 For years, and for all the mounting scientific evidence, black holes have remained marooned in the imaginations of artists and the algorithms of splashy computer models of the kind used in Christopher Nolan's outer-space epic “Interstellar.” Now they are more real than ever.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “We have seen what we thought was unseeable,” said Shep Doeleman, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, and director of the effort to capture the image, during a Wednesday news conference in Washington, D.C.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The image, of a lopsided ring of light surrounding a dark circle deep in the heart of a galaxy known as Messier 87, some 55 million light-years away from Earth, resembled the Eye of Sauron, a reminder yet again of the implacable power of nature.

 Kip Thorne, an astrophysicist at the California Institute of Technology, and who shared a Nobel Prize in 2017 for the discovery of gravitational waves from colliding black holes, wrote in an email: “It is wonderful to see the nearly circular shadow of the black hole.

 The mystery of black holes has tantalized astronomers for more than half a century.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In the 1950s, astronomers with radio telescopes discovered that pearly, seemingly peaceful galaxies were spewing radio energy from their cores — far more energy than would be produced by the ordinary thermonuclear engines that make stars shine.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Perhaps, astrophysicists thought, the energy was being liberated by matter falling onto supermassive, dense objects — later called black holes. Since then, scientists have devised detailed models of how this would work. As hot, dense gas swirls around the black hole, like water headed down a drain, the intense pressures and magnetic fields cause energy to squirt out the side. As a paradoxical result, supermassive black holes can be the most luminous objects in the universe.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The images released today bolster the notion of violence perpetrated over cosmic scales, said Sera Markoff, an astrophysicist at the University of Amsterdam, and a member of the Event Horizon team. “Black holes must be the most exotic major disrupters of cosmic order,” she said.

 he unveiling today took place almost exactly a century after images of

  stars askew in the heavens
 </a>
 made Einstein famous and confirmed his theory of general relativity as the law of the cosmos. That theory ascribes gravity to the warping of space and time by matter and energy, much as a mattress sags under a sleeper.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 General relativity led to a new conception of the cosmos, in which space-time could quiver, bend, rip, expand, swirl like a mix-master and even disappear forever into the maw of a black hole.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 To Einstein’s surprise, the equations indicated that when too much matter or energy was concentrated in one place, space-time could collapse, trapping matter and light in perpetuity. He disliked that idea, but the consensus today is that the universe is speckled with black holes furiously consuming everything around them.
</p><p class="css-1uuihdo">
 A planet-sized network of radio telescopes has assembled the first image of a black hole.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Many are the gravitational tombstones of stars that burned up their fuel and collapsed. But others, hidden in the center of nearly every galaxy, are millions or billions of times more massive than the sun.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Nobody knows how such behemoths of nothingness could have been assembled. Dense wrinkles in the primordial energies of the Big Bang? Monster runaway stars that collapsed and swallowed up their surroundings in the dawning years of the universe?
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Nor do scientists know what ultimately happens to whatever falls into a black hole, nor what forces reign at the center, where, theoretically, the density approaches infinity and smoke pours from nature’s computer.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Any lingering doubts about the reality of black holes dissolved three years ago when the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, detected
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/science/ligo-gravitational-waves-black-holes-einstein.html?module=inline" title="">

 </a>
 through the fabric of space-time.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Now
 <!-- -->
 the reality
 <!-- -->
 has a face.
 <!-- -->
 Peter Galison, a physicist, filmmaker and historian at Harvard, and a member of the Event Horizon team, noted that there is “a wonderful open-ended sense of being able to see something” instead of merely accumulating statistical evidence.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Still, questions about gravity and the universe abound. “We know there must be something more,” Avery Broderick, a physicist at the University of Waterloo, in Ontario, told the audience in Washington, D.C. “Black holes are one of the places to look for answers.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Proving that the monsters in Virgo and the center of the Milky Way were really black holes required measuring the sizes of their shadows. That was no easy job. Both look exceedingly small from this distance, and resolving their tiny details would be a challenge for even the biggest individual telescope.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Moreover, the view is blurred by the charged particles such as electrons and protons that fill interstellar space. “It’s like looking through frosted glass,” said Dr. Doeleman, director of the Event Horizon Telescope.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 To see into the shadows, astronomers needed to be able to tune their radio telescope to shorter wavelengths. And they needed a bigger telescope.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Enter the Event Horizon Telescope, the dream child of Dr. Doeleman. By combining data from radio telescopes as far apart as the South Pole, France, Chile and Hawaii, using a technique called very long baseline interferometry, Dr. Doeleman and his colleagues created a telescope as big as Earth itself, with the power to resolve details as small as an orange on the lunar surface.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In April 2017, the network of eight telescopes, including the South Pole Telescope, synchronized by atomic clocks, stared at the two targets off and on for 10 days.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 For two years, the Event Horizon team reduced and collated the results. The data were too voluminous to transmit over the internet, so they were placed on hard disks and flown back to M.I.T.’s
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.haystack.mit.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

  Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy
 </a>
 , in Bonn, Germany.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The data from the South Pole could not arrive before December 2017, Dr. Doeleman said in an interview, “because it was Antarctic winter, when nothing could go in or out.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Last year the team divided into four groups to assemble images from the data dump. To stay objective and guard against bias, the teams had no contact with each other. They readied themselves for an inconclusive or ambiguous result — a blur, perhaps, that they couldn’t quite read.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Dr. Doeleman grew optimistic last year at a dinner attended by some of the younger members of the team, who showed him the first data for M87.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “There were clear signatures of a ringlike structure,” he said. After dinner, he went to his office and made some crude calculations. “That was one of those great moments,” he said. “It was a surprise how clear this image is.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 As matter swirls into a black hole, it accretes into a disk just outside the abyss’s edge.
 <!-- -->
 The ring of light in the new image corresponds to the innermost orbit of photons, the quantum particles that make up light. By laying a ruler across that ring, astronomers could measure the size of the black hole and see that it met Einstein’s prescription.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The measurement also gave a firm estimate of the mass of the Virgo black hole: 6.5 billion solar masses. That is heavier than most previous determinations, and it suggests that the masses of other big black holes may need to be revised upward.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The observations also revealed that
 <!-- -->
 the accretion disk — the doughnut of doom —
 <!-- -->
 is on its side with regard to Earth, the hole facing us and spinning clockwise. The image is brighter where gas flows around the hole, toward us.

 Dr. Doeleman described the black hole in the center of the Milky Way as “a fascinating, interesting object.” But it is much smaller than the Virgo black hole, so its portrait is harder to capture. That task lies ahead for the Event Horizon Telescope.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The telescope network continues to grow. In April 2018, a telescope in Greenland was added to the collaboration. Another observation run was made of the Milky Way and M87, and captured twice the amount of data gathered in 2017. That data was not part of the results released today, but will be used to confirm them and monitor the behavior of the black holes. Two more antennas are waiting to join the Event Horizon Telescope.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “The plan is to carry out these observations indefinitely and see how things change,” said Dr. Doeleman, embarking on his new career as a tamer of extragalactic beasts.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “It’s astonishing to think humans can turn the Earth into a telescope and see a black hole,” and still more amazing to do it with this team, he said. “That’s the best.”

 BURBANK, Calif. — Walt Disney Co priced its highly anticipated streaming video service below Netflix in an aggressive move to challenge the dominant streaming service and entice families to buy yet another monthly subscription.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Disney said on Thursday its new family-friendly streaming service will cost $7 monthly or $70 annually with a slate of new and classic TV shows and movies from some of the world's most popular entertainment franchises in a bid to challenge the digital dominance of Netflix.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The ad-free monthly subscription called Disney+ is set to launch on Nov. 12 and in every major global market over time, the company said. In addition to Disney films and TV shows, it will feature programming from the Marvel superhero universe, the "Star Wars" galaxy, "Toy Story" creator Pixar animation the National Geographic channel and the entire library of "The Simpsons."
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "What we are putting forward is an aggressive strategy," Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger told analysts at the presentation. "We've got to be very serious and all in on it."
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The company set a target of luring between 60 million to 90 million subscribers and achieving profitability in fiscal year 2024. It plans to plow a little over $1 billion in cash to finance original programming in fiscal 2020 and about $2 billion by 2024.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The cost of the service was lower than the $7.50 per month that Wall Street analysts expected on average, according to a Reuters poll, and could likely be seen as a stronger bid to appeal to more customers.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Patrice Cucinello, a director at Fitch Ratings, said Disney had priced the new service "very affordably."
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "Disney is approaching streaming offerings, particularly Disney+, with guns blazing, looking to take share and quickly ramp subscriber growth," Cucinello said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 To get it in front of more people, Disney said it has struck deals with Roku Inc and Sony Corp to distribute Disney+ on streaming devices and console gaming systems and expects it to be widely available on smart televisions, tablets, and other outlets by launch. It did not mention if it would be available on Apple Inc's upcoming video service.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Disney kicked off its presentation to Wall Street analysts at its Burbank, California, headquarters on Thursday with a video that demonstrated the breadth of its portfolio, showing clips from dozens of classic TV shows and movies from "Frozen" and "The Lion King" to "Avatar" and "The Sound of Music."
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The transformation of the Mouse House, as it is known, from a cable television powerhouse into a leader of streaming media could be Iger's final legacy as he told Wall Street analysts he would not extend his contract beyond 2021 and was working with the board of directors on a succession plan.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 GLOBAL GROWTH
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Executives said they see opportunities to take its ESPN+ sport streaming video service to Latin America and are looking into international expansion of its Hulu streaming video business, which offers movies and shows targeted to adults.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Disney also forecast Hulu's subscribers to reach 40 million to 60 million by fiscal 2024 and reach profitability in the United States by either 2023 or 2024. Hulu currently has 25 million subscribers and is expected to lose $1.5 billion in the current fiscal year.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The digital push is Disney's response to cord-cutting, the dropping of cable service that has hit its ESPN sports network and other channels, and the rise of Netflix Inc. The Silicon Valley upstart has amassed 139 million customers worldwide since it began streaming 12 years ago.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Disney will join the market at a time when audiences are facing a host of choices, and monthly bills, for digital entertainment. Apple, AT&amp;T Inc's WarnerMedia and others plan new streaming services.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 To bolster its potential digital portfolio, Disney recently purchased film and TV assets from Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox and gained prized properties such as "Avatar."
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Disney had been supplying new movies such as "Black Panther" and "Beauty and the Beast" to Netflix after their runs in theaters but ended that arrangement this year to feed its own streaming ambitions. The company estimated it is foregoing $150 million in licensing revenue this fiscal year by saving programming for its own platforms.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Disney+ programming will draw in part from Disney's deep library of classic family films. It also will include exclusive original content such as a live-action "Star Wars" series called "The Mandalorian," a show focused on Marvel movie villain Loki, and animated "Monsters at Work," inspired by hit Pixar movie "Monsters Inc."
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Some new Disney movies, such as a "Lady and the Tramp" remake, will go directly to the Disney+ app. Other new releases will appear on Disney+ after their run in theaters and after they cycle out of the home video sales window, executives have said.

</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 (Reuters) - Shares of Walt Disney Co touched an all-time high on Friday after Wall Street analysts said the aggressive pricing of its new video streaming service could help it better compete with Netflix Inc.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Netflix's shares fell about 4 percent after Disney priced its streaming service, Disney+, at $6.99 per month, below the video streaming pioneer's basic plan of $8.99.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "Investors find a lot of promise in Disney's offerings because it's well positioned to fight the likes of Netflix for consumers' money," said Clement Thibault, analyst at global financial markets platform Investing.com.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Shares of Disney jumped 10 percent to $128.26, adding $21 billion to the company's market capitalization of $209 billion on Thursday.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 J.P. Morgan analysts also noted that Disney+'s interface appears similar to that of Netflix with personalization of user profiles, recommended content, search capabilities and parental controls.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Disney+ will launch on Nov. 12 in the United States, featuring content from a host of Disney brands including Marvel, Star Wars and Pixar as well as recently acquired Fox properties such as "The Simpsons" and National Geographic programming.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Disney said it expects to attract between 60 million and 90 million subscribers and achieve profitability in fiscal year 2024. It plans to plow a little over $1 billion in cash to finance original programming in fiscal 2020 and about $2 billion by 2024.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "It's still very early on, but the streaming war has officially begun. By fighting back with a competitive offering, Disney at least gives itself a chance to win in the streaming industry, rather than just losing user after user to other streaming services," Thibault said.

 WINTER PARK, Fla. — Authorities in Florida had hoped Buzz Lightyear could help catch a burglar.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Winter Park Police Department on Thursday posted images of a man who they initially said stole a Walt Disney World MagicBand during a residential burglary. MagicBands are all-in-one wristbands that allow users to enter theme parks and charge food and merchandise.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 They also track where a person has been at Disney World.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Winter Park detectives tweeted an image of the man firing a toy weapon at a Buzz Lightyear ride at Disney World and asked the public to call them if they recognized him.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Hours later, the agency tweeted that the man in the image wasn't involved in the burglary and they were given inaccurate information. The agency apologized to the unidentified man.

 NEW YORK — AT&amp;T has sold its 9.5% share in Hulu back to the streaming TV company, leaving Disney and Comcast as its owners.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Hulu said Monday that AT&amp;T sold its stake for $1.43 billion, valuing the unprofitable Hulu at $15 billion.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Walt Disney Co. wound up with a 60% share after its purchase of much of 21st Century Fox, which included Fox's Hulu stake. NBCUniversal parent Comcast Corp. owns 30%. There is speculation that Comcast will sell too, leaving Disney the sole owner and perhaps making Hulu's content much more Disney-centric.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Disney may bundle Hulu with its upcoming kids-focused streaming service, Disney Plus, and its sports service, ESPN Plus, executives said last week.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Hulu's $6-a-month service lets users watch original series and network TV episodes after they air on TV. It has a newer live-TV service that costs $45 a month.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 AT&amp;T came by its Hulu stake after buying Time Warner, which invested $583 million in Hulu in 2016. Now the company, known as WarnerMedia, is launching its own streaming service later this year, which will focus on HBO and other shows and movies owned by the company.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 NBCUniversal, too, will debut a streaming service in 2020.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The fragmentation of streaming services may mean higher costs for consumers as they hunt down all their favorite shows and movies across different services.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Hulu CEO Randy Freer said in a statement that AT&amp;T's WarnerMedia, which provides content to Hulu, will remain "a valued partner."

 LOS ANGELES — The directors of "Avengers: Endgame" pleaded with fans on Tuesday not to spoil the movie by giving away storylines after reports that some scenes had leaked online.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In an open letter posted on Twitter under the hashtag #DontSpoilTheEndgame, Joe and Anthony Russo said they and the vast cast of the upcoming Marvel superhero movie "have worked tirelessly for the last three years with the sole intention of delivering a surprising and emotionally powerful conclusion" to the saga.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "When you see Endgame in coming weeks, please don't spoil it for others, the same way you wouldn't want it spoiled for you," they added.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Walt Disney Co's "Avengers: Endgame" marks the conclusion of a story told across 22 Marvel films. The plot has been shrouded in secrecy, with no advance screenings for the entertainment press. Sales of advance tickets earlier this month surpassed those of 2015 movie "Star Wars: The Force Awakens."
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The film, which brings together multiple comic book characters, starts its rollout on April 24 in Australia and China before arriving in the United States on April 25.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Some fans said on Tuesday they had seen brief, grainy scenes on Reddit, YouTube and other platforms, but the footage was swiftly removed. Reuters has not seen the leaked scenes and Disney declined to comment.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The #DontSpoilTheEnding hashtag was one of the top Twitter trends on Tuesday. Some fans who said they had viewed the leaks said they only increased their anticipation for the movie.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "I was upset for about 0.2 seconds then realized how cool it was and it made me so hyped," a person with the user name thestaggie posted on Reddit.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Chris Smith, a contributor to the BGR.com entertainment and tech news site, wrote that he had seen a leak but that it "doesn't really give away the ending" of the movie, although it contained scenes that had not been shown in any of the trailers or official clips released so far.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "I don’t consider that the leak has actually ruined the movie for me. It just makes me want to watch it even more than I already did," wrote Smith.

 AUGUSTA, Ga. — Augusta National Golf Club holds a unique place in the American psyche.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Slow to integrate, and with only male members until seven years ago, the private club is among the most exclusive playgrounds in the country, a haven for masters of the universe and Southern aristocracy.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And then, for one week each year, the club throws opens its gates to welcome tens of thousands of “patrons,” the world’s top golfers and a handful of aging legends. They all line up just after sunrise and enter a world bursting with color and towering pine trees.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 There is an unreal quality to it. The grass underfoot doesn’t feel like the grass in your front yard. Does that shade of pink and purple azalea exist anywhere else? How is it possible that amid all this vegetation, there are seemingly no bugs?
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Perhaps it’s best not to ask these questions. Answers will probably not be provided. So take in the splendor of the fans in their colorful golf shirts and sundresses reflecting off the ponds, and the magical talents of players who can skip golf balls off the water.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Gaze at all those spots that had existed only on television. There’s the Hogan Bridge over Rae’s Creek. There’s the patch of pine straw where Bubba Watson stood when he somehow hooked that miracle shot onto the 10th green in 2012. And look at all those green blazers. The members wear these throughout the week, in case you were wondering.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Open your eyes. There is much to see.

</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 SAN FRANCISCO — Disney raised the curtain on a hotly anticipated video steaming service that's aiming to topple industry pioneer Netflix, once a valuable ally of the Magic Kingdom.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The service, called Disney Plus, has been in the works for more than year, but Thursday marked the first time that the longtime entertainment powerhouse has laid out plans for its attack on Netflix and a formidable cast of competitors, including Amazon, HBO Go and Showtime Anytime.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Disney Plus will roll out in the U.S. on November 12 at a price of $6.99 per month, or $69.99 per year. That's well below the $13 monthly fee Netflix charges for its most popular streaming plan, signaling Disney's determination to woo subscribers as it vies to become a major player in a field that has turned "binge watching" into a common ritual.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Like Netflix, Disney Plus will be free of ads. Subscribers will be able to download all of the shows and movies on Disney's service to watch offline.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Netflix will still have a far deeper video programming lineup after spending tens of billions of dollars during the past six years on original shows such as "House of Cards," ''Stranger Things" and "The Crown."
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But Disney Plus will be able to draw upon a library of revered films dating back several decades while it also forges into original programming. Its animated classics, including "Aladdin" and "The Jungle Book" will be available on the service when it launches.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 New shows already on tap include "The Mandalorian," the first live action "Star Wars" series, created by Jon Favreau; a prequel to the "Star Wars" film "Rogue One," starring Diego Luna; a series about the Marvel character Loki, starring Tom Hiddleston; a rebooted "High School Musical" series; and a new documentary series focused on Disney.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Disney is approaching the streaming industry from a "position of strength, confidence and unbridled optimism," CEO Bob Iger said Thursday. Iger has led the company since 2005 and expects to step down when his contract ends in 2021.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The service's entire lineup will cover five categories: Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Although Disney has an enviable track record of producing shows and films that attract huge audiences, its attempt to build its own Netflix is risky. To make the leap, Disney ended a lucrative licensing relationship with Netflix, which had become the video streaming home for its latest films after their theatrical release, as well as many of its TV series and classic movies.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But now movies that came out in 2019, and going forward, will be streamed only on Disney Plus. That includes "Captain Marvel," which came out earlier this year; "Avengers: Endgame," which debuts in late April; and the upcoming "Toy Story 4," live-action movies "The Lion King" and "Aladdin;" and "Star Wars Episode IX."
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In many ways, it's hard to compare Netflix with Disney because of the widely different types of shows each offers, said eMarketer analyst Paul Verna.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "The interesting thing is both companies have ended up in the same place, but they've come to it from vastly different backgrounds," he said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Disney will also contend with a new streaming service from Apple, which is expected to be released in the fall. Apple has not yet said how much its service will cost or when exactly it will launch.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Last month, Disney completed its biggest deal yet with its $71 billion acquisition of Fox's entertainment business. The first 30 seasons of "The Simpsons" will now stream exclusively on Disney Plus.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Fox takeover helps Disney tighten its control over TV shows and movies from start to finish — from creating the programs to distributing them though television channels, movie theaters, streaming services and other avenues. Disney will also get valuable data on customers and their entertainment-viewing habits, which it can then use to sell advertising.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Fox deal also gave Disney a controlling stake in Hulu. Iger has said Hulu will continue to offer general entertainment programming while Disney Plus will be focused on family fare.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Along with its strong brand, Disney has the advantage of having a clear strategy for each of its streaming services, Verna said, including Disney Plus, Hulu and ESPN Plus. Disney executives hinted the company would "likely" bundle the three at a discounted price, but declined to give more details.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Terminating its deal with Netflix will cost Disney about $150 million in licensing revenue alone during its current fiscal year ending in September.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Disney is betting its new service will quickly offset that. By dangling a mix of familiar franchises and beloved animated classics, along with original programming, it figures the new service will be irresistible to families, even if they already subscribe to other services. It expects Disney Plus to be profitable during its 2024 fiscal year.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The plunge into video streaming is likely to confront Disney with new challenges. One of the biggest dilemmas will center on how long Disney waits after a new film's theatrical release to make it available on its new streaming service.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Disney said movies would become available on its streaming service only after the traditional theatrical release period and home movie debut, which includes DVDs and purchasing streaming videos. That puts its schedule behind that of some competitors. Netflix films such as the award-winning "Roma" and "The Ballad of Buster Scruggs" have either become available for streaming on the same day or just a few days after their short runs in theaters.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 With nearly 140 million worldwide subscribers, Netflix already has proven its mettle while warding off one competitive threat after another in the 12 years since it pivoted from DVD-by-mail rentals to video streaming.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Now, Netflix is locking horns with a company that has been steadily expanding upon its Disney franchise during a shopping spree that has seen it snap up other major studios.

  What does this image really tell us besides black holes are round?
 </strong>
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This is the first look into the central engine that generates the enormous energies put out by quasars, radio galaxies and other so-called active galactic nuclei. The action all starts down at the edge of oblivion, in a maelstrom of hot gas, gravity, magnetic fields and otherworldly pressures. It extends out beyond the far reaches of the galaxy, as jets of radio-wave energy moving at nearly the speed of light; these lobes of radio energy can accompany shock waves capable of
 <!-- -->
 blowing the gas out of galaxies or even entire clusters of them,
 <!-- -->
 preventing stars from forming. Through these mechanisms, black holes, blowing hot and cold, control the growth and structure of galaxies. It all starts in the accretion disk, the doughnut of doom.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  Why does it look like a “doughnut of doom” and not a sphere?
 </strong>
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When matter falls together into a black hole, or in almost any other situation, it has angular momentum, and takes on the shape of a flattened pancake spinning around the central attraction. Also, the black hole is probably spinning, pulling the disk around in the same direction. We are seeing the disk almost directly face-on, so it looks like a doughnut hole.
 <!-- -->
 (From
 <!-- -->
 edge-on
 <!-- -->
 it would look different.) Bent by gravity, light wraps around the hole on its way to our eyes,
 <!-- -->
 so the
 <!-- -->
 black hole magnifies and distorts the image of the accretion disk.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  Will we ever get a clearer image of this black hole?
 </strong>
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 We will. The key is to observe black holes at shorter and shorter radio wavelengths, which allows more and more detail to be resolved. The latest images were recorded at a wavelength of
 <!-- -->
 1.3
 <!-- -->
 millimeters in the microwave band. The Event Horizon team hopes to go to shorter wavelengths in the future, and to use more antennas, including one in space, which would increase the size of their "virtual telescope" and also increase resolution.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  Do you feel that coverage of the breakthrough minimized the role of Katherine Bouman, a researcher at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics?
 </strong>
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The issue of the unsung hero or heroine is a big problem, especially in Big Science, which the Event Horizon Telescope is surely part of.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 There were 207 people in the collaboration, according to one of the physicists I talked to that day. I am sure that many crucial contributions and rich anecdotes of behind-the-scenes science got missed.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In time, these will come out in more thoughtful, longer narratives. On the day of the announcement there was a tsunami of information released at 9 a.m., and a rush to post stories as soon as possible, an unfortunate fact of the internet age.

  What does current science tell us is supposed to happen in the gravitational extremes of a black hole?
 </strong>
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 That’s the biggie everybody wants to know. Whatever happens there, it probably is similar to what happened, maybe in reverse, in the Big Bang. Space, time, matter all go away, replaced by what? Some people think the answers might come from string theory, which unites gravity with quantum theory. But for now it remains an

 , but mathematically elegant, speculation.

  What happens when two black holes collide?
 </strong>
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Such collisions have happened and been recorded by the

 </a>
 . They vibrated the space-time continuum like a drum and released as much energy in a fraction of a second as all the stars in the observable universe. The result in each case was an even bigger, blended black hole.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But outside the event horizon, the gravitational field of a black hole is just like that of a star and it is no more dangerous. Black holes don't go roaming around looking to swallow you. They only hurt if you touch them, in which case you won't ever be able to let go. Otherwise they are like any other animal that you would just let go, and mind your own business.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">

  How is any of this relevant to our day-to-day lives?

</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It can certainly provide context to your daily life, but it won’t move the markets. It will, or could, move your soul. However, Einstein, when he invented the sort of trampoline universe described by general relativity, did not dream that it would lead to pocket devices that keep time and tell you precisely where you are on Earth — that is to say, GPS. But they depend crucially on general relativity to tell you where you are. So who knows?

 SANTA MONICA, Calif. — After a 20-month absence, “Game of Thrones” stormed back on Sunday night, setting a new ratings record.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The season premiere of the show’s eighth — and final — season had 17.4 million viewers, including viewership through its digital channels, HBO said. The previous record
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/28/arts/television/game-of-thrones-finale-sets-ratings-record.html?module=inline" title="">
  for a single episode
 </a>
 of the series was 16.9 million, for the seventh-season finale in August 2017.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 HBO had 11.8 million viewers watching it the old-fashioned way on regular television, according to Nielsen. That narrowly missed the record of 12.1 million who watched the seventh-season finale on television.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When there are more television shows than ever and so many of them are watched on viewers’ own schedules, “Thrones” is one of the few hit series left that qualify as appointment viewing.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 After Sunday night’s premiere, all of Twitter’s top trending topics in the United States were “Thrones”-related.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Still, many more people will be watching it in the days to come. Last season, HBO said an average of 32.8 million viewers watched “Thrones.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 There are only five episodes left in the series, with four of the last five episodes with run times at around 80 minutes. Sunday’s episode was a relatively modest 54 minutes.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 HBO is in victory lap mode as it finally wraps up the most popular show in its network’s history. The network is
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/arts/television/game-of-thrones-series.html?module=inline" title="">
  exploring ways to expand
 </a>
 the “Thrones” franchise. A prequel will begin filming next month, though HBO executives have been reluctant to use the word “franchise” in its future development plans for a “Thrones” universe, the way Disney has taken advantage of its “Star Wars” franchise.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But it is also an anxious time for the premium cable channel. AT&amp;T, which assumed full ownership of HBO in June, has signaled that it’s bringing great change to Warner Media, HBO’s parent.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Richard Plepler, HBO’s longtime chief executive,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/business/media/richard-plepler-hbo-ceo.html?module=inline" title="">
  stepped down
 </a>
 in late February after he felt that he was losing the independence that he was accustomed to. Several other HBO executives have departed in the months since. Robert Greenblatt, the former chairman of NBC Entertainment,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/business/media/robert-greenblatt-att-hbo.html?module=inline" title="">
  took over as chairman
 </a>
 of Warner Media’s entertainment division in March.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And HBO will also have to find a way to keep subscribers happy as “Thrones” signs off. The season will conclude its run on May 19.

 NEW YORK — ESPN+, Walt Disney Co's sports video streaming service, could attract between 8 million and 12 million paying subscribers by the end of the fiscal 2024 year, the company said on Thursday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Disney's forecast for significant growth in paying customers in the next few years was disclosed in a presentation of its streaming video strategy to Wall Street.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Operating losses for ESPN+ are expected to be $650 million annually in both fiscal 2019 and 2020, Disney's chief financial officer, Christine McCarthy, said during an investor day webcast presentation. But the service, which launched one year ago, should reach profitability by 2023, she said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "I view this positively because I think that they need to illustrate the subscriber growth to validate the investment. They're putting out some very strong number guides to the market," said Patrice Cucinello, a director at Fitch Ratings. "They're going guns blazing at direct consumer."
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 As cable and traditional media companies lose subscribers to the likes of Netflix Inc, they are building new streaming video businesses that appeal directly to consumers.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Disney launched ESPN+ a year ago as a way to test its streaming services and distribute additional sports content directly to fans, for a monthly or yearly fee.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Since then, ESPN+ has drawn millions of subscribers, inked sports rights deals, and seen its mobile app rise in popularity. Disney is also moving forward with its larger plans for Disney+, which will stream its trove of new and classic blockbuster movies.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 As for current paying sports fans, Disney said the number was currently over 2 million, or roughly what it disclosed in February.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Disney's own estimates about ESPN+ growth seemed slightly higher than analysts, though its time frame was longer.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Morgan Stanley analysts expect 2.7 million people to be paying for ESPN+ access by the end of fiscal 2019 and 3.9 million by the end of fiscal 2020. By 2022, it could have 6.7 million, Morgan Stanley said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 MoffettNathanson gave a more modest outlook, predicting that ESPN+ will end fiscal 2019 flat, with just 2 million subscribers, growing to 4 million by 2022 and 5 million by 2023.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Analysts at Citi predicted that ESPN+ would have 4 million paying subscribers by fiscal 2020.

 NEW YORK — A rush of newcomers couldn't shake "Shazam!" from the top spot, as the superhero comedy led the box office for the second straight weekend with $25.1 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Lionsgate's "Hellboy" reboot, the animated Laika Studios release "Missing Link," the college romance "After" and even the long-delayed "Mary Magdalene," originally to be released by the Weinstein Co., all opened in theaters. But the strongest new release of them all was, predictably, the Will Packer-produced one: "Little."
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The body-swap comedy "Little" came in second with $15.5 million for Universal Pictures. Made for just $20 million, "Little" is just the most recent profit-maker for Packer, the "Girls Trip" producer.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The film, directed by Tina Gordon Chism, stars 14-year-old Marsai Martin as the child an abusive tech executive (Regina Hall) reverts to after a magical spell is cast on her. Martin, the "black-ish" star, also executive produced the film, the youngest ever so credited in Hollywood history.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "Little" drew a largely female (65 and African American (43%) audience. Jim Orr, Universal Pictures distribution chief, credited the cast, Chism's direction and Packer's overall know-how.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "He's done it with different kinds of films. 'Breaking In' was a thriller, 'Girls Trip' was an R-rated comedy. 'Little' is kind of an all-ages film, PG-13 rated,'" said Orr, whose studio signed a first-look deal with Packer in 2013. "He's a brand. And he has a great idea of what is going to be successful at the box office."
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was an out-of-body weekend at the box office. The body-swap comic-book adaptation "Shazam!" — about a teenage boy (Asher Angel) who can turn into an adult-sized superhero (Zachary Levi) with a simple command — held solidly in its second week. Capitalizing on good reviews and word-of-mouth, "Shazam!" is Warner Bros.' New Line's latest DC Comics success. It has grossed $94.9 million through Sunday with a worldwide total of $258.8 million.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Lionsgate and Millennium's "Hellboy" had been expected by many to vie with "Shazam!" on the weekend. But on the heels of terrible reviews (just 15% "fresh" on Rotten Tomatoes), it flopped with $12 million against a $50 million budget.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 That's significantly less than the debuts of the 2004 original ($23 million opening) and the 2008 sequel ($34.5 million opening). Those films were directed by Guillermo de Toro and starred Ron Perlman; the new "Hellboy" stars David Harbour ("Stranger Things") and is directed by Neil Marshall.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "Missing Link" also missed. It opened with a disappointing $5.8 million, marking a new low for Laika, the maker of eccentric animated tales such as "Coraline," ''ParaNorman" and "Kubo and the Two Strings." ''Missing Link," distributed by United Artists Releasing, is about the discovery of a creature in the Pacific Northwest. Its voice cast includes Zach Galifianakis, Hugh Jackman and Zoe Saldana.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Expectations had varied widely for Aviron Pictures' "After," an adaption of Anna Todd's 2014 best-seller. The young-adult drama fared well with $6.2 million in 2,138 theatres.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 And "Mary Magdalene," starring Rooney Mara as Mary and Joaquin Phoenix as Jesus, finally opened, more than three years after production. Harvey Weinstein had once conceived of the film, directed by Garth Davis ("Lion") as his next Oscar contender.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 After the fallout of Weinstein and the bankruptcy of the Weinstein Co., IFC Films acquired the biblical biopic. Critics dismissed it (44% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and audiences mostly did, too. It grossed about $62,000 on 62 screens.

 NEW YORK — The Notre-Dame de Paris, which sustained a devastating fire Monday, has inspired writers, painters and filmmakers for hundreds of years. Here are some notable examples:
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 PAINTING: Henri Matisse painted it often— in intimate blue, a distant green, a pinkish haze. It served as a melancholy backdrop for William-Adolphe Bouguereau's "The Bohemian," while the interior provided a golden, grandiose aura for Jacques-Louis David's "The Coronation of Napoleon."
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 BOOKS: Think of books about Notre Dame and you'll inevitably begin with Victor Hugo's "Notre-Dame of Paris" (otherwise known as "The Hunchback of Notre-Dame"), his 1831 masterpiece. But Notre Dame also appears in works ranging from Balzac's "The Wrong Side of Paris" to the "Babar" and "Madeline" children's series.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 MOVIES: It's there, of course, in the adaptations of Hugo's novel, whether the 1939 version starring Charles Laughton, the 1956 remake with Anthony Quinn or the 1996 Disney musical featuring the voices of Tom Hulce and Demi Moore among others. You'll spot it, too, in the background as Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn converse in "Charade," and as Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy cruise along the Seine in "Before Sunset," as Hawke marvels at its surviving the Nazi occupation of World War II and Delpy responds, "But you have to think that Notre Dame will be gone one day."
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 MUSIC: "Dark was the night when our tale was begun/On the docks near Notre Dame," sing David Ogden Stiers, Paul Kandel and Tony Jay in the Disney film, the soundtrack composed by Alan Menken. In ABBA's "One Last Summer," it's a sentimental detail ("In the tourist jam, round the Notre-Dame/Our last summer/Walking hand in hand"). It's an object of awe in Garland Jefferies' "Jump Jump" ("We pass Notre Dame/So much history/So much bigger than me") and a brooding symbol in Roxy Music's "Europe" ("And here by the Seine/Notre Dame casts/A long lonely shadow").

 Two weeks ago, the big movie studios showcased their 2019 lineups for multiplex executives in a series of elaborate marketing presentations in Las Vegas. It’s an annual ritual: Here are the potential hits we will deliver.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 For the first time, the importance of onscreen diversity came across as more than lip service. Paramount presented a family adventure (“

 ”) with an actor of Indian descent playing the lead.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But look a little closer at the movies on studio rosters — and who is directing them — and Hollywood’s inclusion narrative falls apart by one crucial measure. Even after years of being called to task for sidelining female filmmakers, studios as a whole continue to rely overwhelmingly on men to lead productions.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Why the disconnect?
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Studios have multiple explanations (some would say excuses), but one big reason involves a lack of economic pressure. Moviegoers have been responding favorably to diverse casting and stories (“Us,” “Crazy Rich Asians,” “Black Panther”), prompting studios to serve up more. Fewer ticket-buying decisions are made based on the gender of the filmmaker, however.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Does a consumer care about how something is made versus what they see onscreen?” Cathy Schulman, an Oscar-winning producer (“Crash”), said in an interview. “I think that is becoming increasingly more important, but I would say the business is slower to see the connectivity.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 That most studios employ few female directors would not surprise anyone who has been paying attention to the
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://assets.uscannenberg.org/docs/inclusion-in-the-directors-chair-2019.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  research
 </a>
 from academics like Stacy L. Smith at the University of Southern California. But most reports on Hollywood hiring offer a rearview portrait; compiling comprehensive data requires a lag.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 So the of-the-moment snapshot provided by the recent studio presentations is striking.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 During its session on April 3 at CinemaCon, a convention staged by the National Association of Theater Owners, Disney unveiled a 19-film slate for the rest of 2019, including a batch of movies from the newly acquired 20th Century Fox. Two of the 19 come from women: Jennifer Lee co-directed “

</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Paramount said in a statement, “We recognize that, as an industry, we need to afford more opportunities to female film directors, and at Paramount we have publicly committed to doing a better job.” Paramount added that, under an

 </a>
 to boost opportunities for female directors.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The only studio executive who agreed to be interviewed for this article was Adam Fogelson, the chairman of STXfilms Motion Picture Group, a five-year-old operation. Much of its output involves female-focused movies like the Amy Schumer vehicle “I Feel Pretty,” directed by Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “We’re proud of our track record of making films for, with and by women,” Mr. Fogelson said. “We see it as an important competitive edge.” He added, however, “As a husband, a father and a human being in the world, I’m eager for the industry to collectively do better on this front.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 STX currently has six films headed to theaters by the end of the year, two of which have female directors. The first is “Poms,” a comedy from Zara Hayes that arrives on May 10. But Mr. Fogelson said a few months’ worth of films did not give a sufficient assessment. By his calculation, 18 percent of all STX movies, past and present, have been (or are being) directed by women — and 14 percent have a woman as lead actor, director, producer
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  and

 writer.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Widening the aperture makes the picture more positive for every studio. Disney recently released “Captain Marvel,” with Anna Boden as a director; in the works are two more Marvel films from women (“Black Widow” and “The Eternals”). Warner will release a pair of female-led superhero movies of its own in 2020 — “Wonder Woman 1984,” from Patty Jenkins, and “Birds of Prey,” from Cathy Yan. At least 10 films with female directors are in development at Paramount, including a new “Star Trek.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The higher the financial risk, though, the less confidence decision makers have in hiring women. So, major studio films remain the slowest to embrace opportunity parity. Ms. Schulman, who is a former president of the advocacy group Women in Film, also pointed to the misconception that women are best at directing personal stories about women and romance, excluding them from opportunities to direct genres associated with men, like action, adventure, espionage, broad comedy, horror, sci-fi and others.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Martha Lauzen, the executive director of the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film and a professor at San Diego State University, cited research showing that women accounted for 8 percent of directors working on the top 250-grossing movies of 2018, down one percentage point from 1998.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “We have not seen any meaningful increase,” she said, “in the percentage of women film directors over the last 20 years.”
</p><p class="css-1e7dx92 evys1bk0">
 An earlier version of this article misidentified the actress who will star in a “Shaft” sequel. She is Regina Hall, not Regina King.

 LOS ANGELES — The fire that devastated Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris on Monday prompted fund-raising appeals in the United States, as people horrified by the blaze began making commitments to restore a global landmark even before the flames were extinguished.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The New York-based French Heritage Society and the Go Fund Me crowdsourcing platform were among the first to offer help for a cathedral that is a must-see destination for visitors to Paris from all over the world.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 French President Emmanuel Macron said an international campaign would be launched to raise funds for the rebuilding of Notre-Dame Cathedral. [nP6N21F04Z]
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The French Heritage Society, an American non-profit group dedicated to preserving French architectural and cultural treasures, launched a web page on Monday to raise money for the cathedral's restoration.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "Notre-Dame is obviously an architectural marvel and most certainly a monument that should be restored," Jennifer Herlein, the executive director of the society, said by phone.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Herlein could not immediately say how much her organization had raised for Notre-Dame on Monday. Eventually, the funds raised will go directly to the cathedral, she said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The organization, which was founded in 1982, gave two grants last year totaling more than $430,000 for restoration projects at France's national library, she said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 50 CAMPAIGNS
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 At the website GoFundMe, more than 50 campaigns related to the cathedral fire had been launched globally on Monday, John Coventry, a spokesman for Go Fund Me, said by email.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "In the coming hours we'll be working with the authorities to find the best way of making sure funds get to the place where they will do the most good," Coventry said.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Some of the Go Fund Me campaigns had not listed any money raised by late Monday, and several joke campaigns were created through Go Fund Me to help Quasimodo, the fictional character in Victor Hugo's 19th century novel "The Hunchback of Notre-Dame."
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "I think the challenge will be whether or not people who give the money agree with those who are doing the rebuilding about how the cathedral should be rebuilt," said Lisa Bitel, a professor of religion and history at the University of Southern California.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "This is a national monument in France and they will not spare money to rebuild," Bitel said. "I don't think the Americans will get much of a say in how to do it."
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Notre-Dame Cathedral has looked to international donors for past renovation efforts.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In 2017, Michel Picaud, president of Friends of Notre-Dame De Paris, told the New York Times his group planned to organize gala dinners, concerts and other events to raise funds in France and the United States for restoration work at the cathedral.

 Speaking from more than 400 feet below the surface of the Indian Ocean, the president of the Seychelles made an impassioned plea on Sunday to protect the world’s seas.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Calling oceans the “beating blue heart of our planet,” the president,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.statehouse.gov.sc/static.php?content_id=2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Danny Faure
 </a>
 , said the sea had “a special relationship with all of us.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. Faure, dressed in salmon-colored shorts and a T-shirt with the Seychelles flag, gave his speech from a submersible craft that had dived to 406 feet off Desroches Island in the Seychelles, part of a series of scientific missions to explore and protect the Indian Ocean.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Marveling at the underwater beauty and biodiversity of his surroundings, Mr. Faure called for more protection for the ocean’s ecosystem.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “It keeps the planet alive, it keeps us alive, and it is clear to me that it is under threat like never before,” he said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The Seychelles, a chain of islands off eastern Africa, faces an existential threat from climate change and rising sea levels. The country, along with

  bear the brunt of global warming
 </a>
 , including the loss of fresh water, land erosion, dying coral reefs and the increased frequency of extreme weather events.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 While global powers have gathered repeatedly for summit meetings on how to reduce and mitigate carbon emissions, island nations have expressed increasing desperation at the lack of meaningful action.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “The ocean is huge, covering almost 70 percent of our planet, but we have managed to seriously impact this vast environment through climate change, ocean acidification, overfishing, plastic and other pollution,” Mr. Faure said, adding, “We need decisive, coordinated, international action.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">

 Oceans are major producers of oxygen — due largely to the actions of phytoplankton, tiny single-celled ocean plants — and they absorb half of all climate-warming carbon dioxide, according to the organization. But the total amount of vertebrate sea life, including fish, has reduced by more than a third since 1970, the fund said.

 Its wingspan is longer than a football field. The tail is 50 feet from the ground. It was made by reassembling parts from two used Boeing jetliners.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 On Saturday, the world’s largest airplane took flight for the first time.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The twin-fuselage plane, called the Stratolaunch, flew for about two and a half hours over the Mojave Desert in Southern California, reaching a speed of 189 miles per hour and an altitude of 17,000 feet in its maiden voyage, the Stratolaunch team said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “The flight itself was smooth, which is exactly what you want the first flight to be,” Evan Thomas, a test pilot with
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.scaled.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Scaled Composites
 </a>
 who flew the Stratolaunch, said at a news briefing. “And for the most part, the airplane flew as predicted, which is again exactly what we want.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The vessel, the largest plane by wingspan, is designed to carry rockets to blast commercial satellites into space. The company is betting that doing so would be more efficient than launching them from the ground, which is an approach of several other space-minded companies.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Paul G. Allen, a founder of Microsoft, funded the project and announced plans for Stratolaunch in 2011.
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/obituaries/paul-allen-dead.html?module=inline" title="">
  Mr. Allen died in October
 </a>
 , prompting questions about the initiative’s future. The company declined to say how much the project cost.
</p><p class="css-1uuihdo">
 Never miss an eclipse, a meteor shower, a rocket launch or any other astronomical and space event that's out of this world.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In August, Stratolaunch said it was developing a “family of launch vehicles” that could be deployed from the plane to carry satellites. But in January the company scaled back those efforts.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 There have been concerns about how Stratolaunch’s business will work once it takes on customers, with some questioning whether a trend toward smaller satellites would dampen demand for such a large plane.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Even so, the flight on Saturday was billed as a milestone and an engineering marvel.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “All of you’ve been very patient and very tolerant over the years waiting for us to get this big bird off the ground, and we finally did it,” Jean Floyd, chief executive of Stratolaunch, said at the briefing.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The team on Saturday checked the plane’s handling, and tested rolls and yaws.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Mr. Thomas said there were a “few little things that were off nominal” but the company did not immediately specify what those were.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “The airplane felt really nice on the touchdown, gear felt good,” Mr. Thomas said. “We had a couple of corrections to line up in the slowdown and ended up rolling to a stop pretty much where we wanted to coming off the runway.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “So it was overall fantastic.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Stratolaunch said that by launching rockets from the air, it can “circumvent bad weather, air traffic and other variables that cause delays with traditional ground launches.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Executives have also said the plane can easily move to areas that are better suited for launching satellites into certain orbits, although it needs a landing strip that can handle its great size.

 When it comes to Beyoncé releases, there is usually an element of surprise.

</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Both the film and the album, also titled “Homecoming,” capture Beyoncé’s performance at last year’s Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, in which the singer — the first black woman to headline the event — was backed by dozens of dancers and an elaborate marching band for a set that nodded to the musical legacy of historically black colleges.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “There’s not likely to be a more meaningful, absorbing, forceful and radical performance by an American musician this year, or any year soon,” the critic Jon Caramanica
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/15/arts/music/beyonce-coachella-review.html?module=inline" title="">
  wrote of the show in The New York Times
 </a>
 . “It was rich with history, potently political and visually grand. By turns uproarious, rowdy, and lush. A gobsmacking marvel of choreography and musical direction.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Now, the concert — which was live-streamed at the time and recreated for Coachella’s second weekend, but has existed only in bootleg form since — has been preserved for history in multiple mediums. The documentary, a Netflix exclusive billed as “a film by Beyoncé,” features footage from rehearsals and quieter backstage moments — “the emotional road from creative concept to cultural movement,” Netflix said.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Homecoming: The Live Album” is a more straightforward recreation of the concert that became known as Beychella. It breaks the more than two-hour performance into 40 tracks, many of which are packed with multiple musical references and sections of other songs.

</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Beyoncé’s set list, which varied slightly over the two Coachella performances, included solo hits like “Get Me Bodied,” “Baby Boy” and “Formation,” the Destiny’s Child songs “Say My Name” and “Soldier” (with her former group mates Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams) and various interludes with titles here such as “So Much Damn Swag” and “The Bzzzz Drumline.” She also included a rendition of the hymn “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” a song often referred to as the black national anthem.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The album also includes an a cappella version of “Lift Every Voice and Sing” by Blue Ivy, Beyoncé and Jay-Z’s oldest daughter, and two bonus tracks: a new cover of “Before I Let Go,” the 1981 song by Maze featuring Frankie Beverly, which appears in the end credits of the documentary, and an alternate version of “I Been On.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 While some recent Beyoncé releases have been available, at least for a time, only on Tidal, the streaming service owned by Jay-Z, the live album was released across all major streaming platforms, including Apple Music, Spotify and Google Play.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Since Coachella, Beyoncé has been largely quiet professionally, though she toured with Jay-Z last summer, surprising fans with the nine-track collaborative effort “Everything Is Love” along the way. She has not announced a follow-up.

 CHICAGO — A top Chicago prosecutor says she hopes to begin expunging minor cannabis convictions in the coming months but acknowledges it won't be easy to implement her plan and that her office is still figuring out its scope.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx told the Chicago Sun-Times last week that she wants to enlist the help of San Francisco-based nonprofit, Code for America, which has already aided with expunging records in California.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Code for America "can help us find some infrastructure support of being able to look at the (Cook County) clerk's office, Dorothy Brown's office, to be able to identify batches of people who are found or convicted of the statutory code for possession of marijuana," Foxx said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Kiera Ellis, a spokeswoman for Foxx, said the state's attorney's office and Code for America have yet to sign an official contract. Code for America spokeswoman Maria Buczkowski confirmed the nonprofit is in discussions with the attorney's office but declined to comment. Ellis previously said that people with convictions will not have to petition for expungements separately.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Foxx estimated that thousands of misdemeanor drug convictions could be wiped out.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "The question is, how far back can we go? How far back does the data go — which will give us what our universe looks like? But we're in the process of figuring that out," she said, adding that she also plans to work with state officials to determine whether her office can file petitions for expungement on behalf of people with minor pot convictions.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Foxx has recently advocated publicly for legalizing recreational marijuana in Illinois.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Her comments come amid backlash over her office's decision to drop charges against "Empire" actor Jussie Smollett, who was accused of staging a racist, anti-gay attack against himself.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Foxx said her office is also examining its policy toward prosecuting those detained for selling marijuana. She said she wanted to review her office's policy given the swift movement toward full decriminalization in Springfield.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 "The next iteration of this is looking at those sales," she said, especially "in light of the fact that legalization looks like it's becoming apparent. We don't want to be on the back end of trying to figure out what to do."
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesman for Chicago police, said the department will stick to its job of "enforcing laws, investigating crimes and presenting our evidence-based findings to prosecutors."
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He referred comments to the state's attorney's office.

</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Five days after Attorney General William Barr released his expectation-deflating summary of the investigation into the Trump campaign’s suspected Russia connections, a pair of videos appeared on YouTube, labeled “Alex Jones / Sandy Hook Video Deposition.” The hundreds of thousands of views those videos have accumulated attest to their appeal as a #Resistance consolation prize: Maybe it’s not a habitually lying president, but at least someone is getting called to account, under oath, for his role in the post-truthification of American public life.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Jones, the Trump-endorsed proprietor of the conspiracy-mongering Infowars media empire, is being
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/us/politics/alex-jones-sandy-hook.html?module=inline" title="">
  sued for defamation by 10 families
 </a>
 of children who were murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. That mass shooting, Jones maintained until recently, was a hoax, perpetrated with the connivance of the victims’ parents — many of whom have found themselves harassed, threatened and in some cases hounded from their homes by believers in this conspiracy theory.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Some ambivalence is probably in order about the practice of publicly posting deposition videos. But in the particular case of Alex Jones — who swam happily in YouTube’s abyssal depths before being mostly banned for hate-speech-policy violations last August — you have to at least appreciate the karmic elegance of it. The deposition is the sort of thing you could imagine him experiencing in a particularly unpleasant dream. In
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7siWJ86g40" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  the video
 </a>
 , he sits at a table, much as he sits behind the desk on his flagship “The Alex Jones Show,” but he is not in charge of the production. Instead, he is compelled to answer
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XES-AydpIoc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  the questions
 </a>
 of a young attorney named Mark Bankston (offscreen and unseen), who over the course of more than three hours meticulously deconstructs the world that Jones has conjured for his audience.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Bankston seems less interested in the “whys” of Jones’s universe — the ultimately unsolvable riddle of how fully Jones believes what he says on the air — than he is in the “hows”: the way information gets chopped and screwed on Infowars, distended and looped and played back into the public discourse. In a way, it’s an examination of the whole unstable architecture of influence in today’s politics. When a particularly cancerous meme surfaces in Trump’s Twitter feed, or when white supremacists suddenly materialize en masse in the streets of a college town, the operative question now always seems to be: Where the hell did
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  that
 </em>
 come from?
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 At one point, Bankston dials in on an April 2017 broadcast in which Jones and his colleague Rob Dew discuss the police inspection of the Sandy Hook school grounds after the shooting. “They’re finding people in the back woods that are dressed up in SWAT gear,” Dew says. Jones, in the video, agrees.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Bankston, in the deposition, reads this aloud and asks Jones: “That’s not true, is it?”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “I saw it on the national news,” Jones says.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “You saw somebody in SWAT gear in the woods?”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Black and camouflage — the police arrested him, they said there was a SWAT drill in the area?” he offers hopefully.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “No, Mr. Jones, I’m asking you: Did you see a video of a man in SWAT gear being arrested?”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Jones, like most conspiracy theorists, presents himself as a close reader of reality, scrutinizing the gaps in the official narrative that reveal the big lie. But when that close reading is itself subjected to a close reading, you realize that Jones’s appeal comes not from his attention to details but from the velocity with which he blows past them — the way he hurtles through an asteroid belt of informational debris on his way to explicating the galaxy-scale perfidy of his villains. The law, and Bankston, do the opposite. They bore patiently inward, toward particularity.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Jones pauses, stares off-camera, blinks. “I saw the helicopter, talking about it, they said they later arrested the man.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “So when you told your audience he was dressed up in SWAT gear, that’s just something you made up, isn’t it? There’s nobody dressed up in SWAT gear.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “I do remember that being on the news,” Jones says.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “What being on the news?”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “The helicopter and the man behind the school. And the report of the guy in the SWAT gear and the police saying they arrested him, and later they said they didn’t —”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Yeah, it’s two reporters with cameras! There’s reports about it. There’s no man in SWAT gear in that video, is there? That’s just something you made up.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Nope, I didn’t make it up,” Jones insists, defiantly but also a little plaintively.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">

  Writing in
 </strong>
 The Daily Beast two years ago, the conservative commentator Matt Lewis
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/alex-jones-youre-a-real-sicko" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  placed Jones in the lineage of right-wing radio talkers
 </a>
 like Rush Limbaugh, who had effectively reverse-engineered politics from pro-wrestling-style confrontational entertainment. The problem is that “politics is inherently different,” Lewis wrote. “The stakes are higher. And since ideas have consequences, our words can have grave consequences.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This was a sly turn of phrase. “Ideas have consequences” has been a conservative battle cry since 1948, when the acerbic anti-modernist Richard M. Weaver
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/I/bo17116688.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  published a book-length polemic
 </a>
 by that title bemoaning the decline of universal truth. “On the verbal level, we see ‘fact’ substituted for ‘truth,’ ” Weaver wrote. “With what pathetic trust does he” — the “average man” — “recite his facts! He has been told that knowledge is power, and knowledge consists of a great many small things.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 As with most adages, the use of “ideas have consequences” has become dumber with time. In the mouths of figures like Limbaugh and Dinesh D’Souza, it calcified into a sort of pretentious playground taunt: You liberals have facts, but we have
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  ideas
 </em>
 ! Alex Jones surely would have appalled Weaver, but he represents the logical, self-parodying extreme of this rhetorical pose, filling in the outlines of an increasingly conservative-traditionalist worldview with ridiculous particulars about demons reincarnated as Clintons. Last week, Candace Owens, the video blogger and recent Infowars on-air presence, was called by House Republicans to testify in a hearing on white supremacy, where she insisted that the so-called Southern strategy — the Nixon-era Republican Party’s wooing of white Southern conservatives — “never happened.” It is not really possible anymore to say where Jones’s universe ends and mainstream conservatism begins.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 What’s commonly lamented as post-truth politics is, if we’re being precise about it, really post-fact politics: not the death of a higher truth (belief in which has proved robust enough) but of that “great many small things.” Small things like whether or not there was a man in SWAT gear in those woods. They might not matter in politics anymore, but they do in a courtroom. “We have a right in this country to question things,” Jones protests at one point in the deposition. To which Bankston replies: “I’m not saying what you didn’t and did have a right to do. I’m just asking you what you did.”

</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 When James Paxton takes the mound at Yankee Stadium on Tuesday, he will be at the center of one of baseball’s hottest rivalries. The crowd will be electric, the atmosphere charged if not primal. And in the Boston Red Sox, Paxton will not just be facing the Yankees’ archenemies, but the defending world champions.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s a lot to ask of any pitcher, but for Paxton, who has been struggling with mechanical and confidence issues, there will be an extra degree of difficulty.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 After spending the first six years of his career with the Seattle Mariners, Paxton is off to a lackluster start with the Yankees: 1-2 with a 6.00 E.R.A., including an especially rough outing against the Houston Astros during which he allowed five runs and two home runs, and was removed in the fifth inning without recording an out. Paxton’s early exit sealed Houston’s three-game sweep of the Yankees, and was yet another reminder that a transition to the Yankees’ universe can be tougher than it looks.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Paxton admits he has been somewhat overwhelmed by the outsize expectations — his own.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “I think just getting that under control and realizing it’s the same game,” Paxton said on Sunday morning, adding: “I think I’ve been trying to do too much, trying to be better than what I am. I realized I’m good enough being who I am or who I was in Seattle.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This is no small issue for Paxton or the Yankees. The team watched Sonny Gray, another small-market talent, pitch himself out of the Bronx in less than two full seasons as a result of his discomfort in front of a bigger, more demanding audience. But unlike Gray, who never successfully confronted those demons, Paxton is working with a sports psychologist he has retained since his minor league days.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Compounding Paxton’s confidence problems is the ease in which Houston detected his pitches last Thursday. For that, the left-hander says he has only himself to blame.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was when he went back over his performance that he realized how obvious his tells had become. Working from the stretch position, Paxton’s raised left index finger would peek out from his glove before throwing the knuckle curve, allowing Astros runners on second base to alert hitters what was coming.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 That would help explain why the Astros looked so comfortable pummeling Paxton.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Going over video with Carlos Beltran, the former Yankee who is now a consultant for the team, helped Paxton grapple with the issue.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Look at these takes. Look at that swing,” Paxton said, recalling Beltran’s words. “They wouldn’t be making these swings or takes if they didn’t know what was coming.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The good news for the Yankees is that Paxton is already working on better camouflage. Now, as he goes into the stretch, he is waiting until the ball is deep in his glove before changing grips. But even with a battened-down delivery, Paxton still has to prove he can handle the pressure that the Boston rivalry can offer.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Granted, the Red Sox have barely resembled the 2018 version of themselves, losing 10 of their first 16 games. The team has been undermined by its pitching staff’s 5.80 E.R.A. — 13th in the American League even after David Price shone in a 4-0 win over Baltimore on Sunday. The Yankees have not fared much better. Their 5-2 loss to the Chicago White Sox on Sunday was their fifth in six games. Except for a three-game wipeout of Baltimore last weekend, the Yankees have dropped every series this season.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Masahiro Tanaka, who had brandished a 1.47 E.R.A., was ambushed by Tim Anderson’s grand slam in the fourth inning on Sunday and was subsequently knocked out in the fifth.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The loss scuttled plans for the Yankees to build momentum heading into the Red Sox series. It was Boston, after all, that on the way to winning the World Series ended the Yankees’ season in a division series last October.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “That left a bad taste in our mouths,” Luke Voit said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s because of the long history of battles between the teams that even amid a sluggish April for both of them, a Yankees-Red Sox showdown can still offer plenty of excitement.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 That’s one of the reasons Paxton will be scrutinized so closely. A pitcher’s worth to the Yankees has always been commensurate to his success against Boston. As a Mariner, Paxton was successful against the Red Sox, going 2-0 with a 2.79 E.R.A. But that calculus changes on Tuesday night, when every inning will feel like the postseason.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Does Paxton have the stomach for what’s around the corner?
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 He acknowledged the concern, saying “I’m sure I’ll be a little nervous going in, having it be my first experience being a part of this rivalry.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Paxton will probably come in loaded up with tips and reminders from his support team: Keep the ball hidden in the glove and keep your wits about you. Breathe slow and easy. But Paxton could simply unload the baggage and adopt C. C. Sabathia’s war cry: Just bring it on.

 In Donald Trump’s two-plus years as president, his approach to policymaking has often been defined by an unsavory stew of indecision, inaction, flip-flops and outright lies.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Nowhere has this been truer than with health care, where the administration has reversed direction multiple times.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 A short history: During his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump said he would produce a health care plan that provided universal coverage and also promised that he would not cut Medicare or Medicaid. “Everybody’s got to be covered,” Mr. Trump
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-60-minutes-scott-pelley/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  told “60 Minutes
 </a>
 ,” a position that he repeated regularly until he took office.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Then he began backing proposals that would eviscerate the Affordable Care Act and severely damage the other programs.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 On his first day in office, Mr. Trump

  signed an executive order
 </a>
 directing government agencies to scale back as much of the A.C.A. as possible while the White House sought “prompt repeal” of the law.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 That was followed by nearly a year of wrangling in Congress as Republicans tried to craft a bill that could attract majorities in both houses.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The effort fell short in September 2017 when John McCain
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/28/us/politics/john-mccain-vote-trump-obamacare.html?module=inline" title="">

  would have cost
 </a>
 16 million Americans their insurance by 2021 and sent premiums soaring for those still covered.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Like the elephant who never forgets, Mr. Trump
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1107020360803909632" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  continues
 </a>
 to hammer Mr. McCain, now deceased, over that vote, even as he professes to be working on a plan to improve health care coverage.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Meanwhile, the administration’s

 The Trojan horse of health care reform, the proposal provides for relatively small initial cuts in federal funding and then

 In the meantime, new regulations — issued pursuant to the president’s Inauguration Day executive order — have chipped away at the A.C.A., leading to a drop in enrollments through the exchanges from 12.7 million in 2016 to 11.4 million this year.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">

  instruction last June
 </a>
 to the Justice Department, which was defending the A.C.A., to argue instead that certain key provisions — notably, the requirement that Americans with pre-existing conditions be treated equally — be declared unconstitutional.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 A win by Mr. Trump in this case could mean that nearly 20 million Americans would lose insurance,

  keep saying
 </a>
 that they are committed to protecting coverage for pre-existing conditions, although acknowledging that under their formulation, people with pre-existing conditions could be forced to pay more than those without.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Confused? That may well be Mr. Trump’s strategy: pretend you want expanded coverage while your operatives are pursuing strategies that would cost millions of Americans their coverage.

</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Garnering less attention but also an important component of Mr. Trump’s health care strategy are the huge cuts that he has proposed to Medicare and Medicaid (again, contrary to
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/596338364187602944" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">

  White House contends
 </a>
 that the $575 billion in Medicare reductions over the next 10 years would come largely from health care providers and would not affect beneficiaries.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 We can debate the veracity of that, but what’s unambiguously true is that the nearly $800 billion in Medicaid reductions would come directly from lower-income Americans.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Fortunately, like most budgets of recent years, Mr. Trump’s proposals — unsupported by a wide majority of legislators — have already been declared dead on arrival on Capitol Hill.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Now Mr. Trump is trying to finesse his way through the 2020 election by promising a plan immediately thereafter. For those of us of a certain age, that’s reminiscent of President Nixon’s false suggestion in the 1968 campaign that he had a “secret plan” to end the war in Vietnam.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Isn’t a plan what Mr. Trump promised in 2016? Are the American people really going to allow him to lie to them again?
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">

 The displays are dazzling, with platforms twirling and lasers dancing off the fenders of the latest and greatest vehicles around. But the New York International Auto Show won’t open to the public until Saturday, and the press preview days are still underway.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Welcome to the preshow off-site launch circuit.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 For two weeks, the New York show is the center of the automotive universe. Last year, 61 vehicles made their debuts at the show. To stand out in this crowd, automakers have created satellite events before the official press reveals at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center on the West Side of Manhattan.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This gives companies a jump on the torrent of announcements and adds pearlescent shine to coverage of their new vehicle.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Chatter in the car world suggests that
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/business/auto-shows-detroit-los-angeles-future.html?module=inline" title="">
  auto shows
 </a>
 have
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/business/auto-shows-carmakers-paris-los-angeles.html?module=inline" title="">
  lost their impact
 </a>
 . Many automakers still see the benefits. Stuart Schorr, the vice president for communications at Jaguar Land Rover North America, finds them to be moments in time when cars are a hot subject.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “It’s an amplifier,” Mr. Schorr said. “It’s all over TV, radio, newspapers, the internet and social media. We make the most of that, creating a bigger impact and expanding the reach.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 This year, Jaguar’s preshow event at the new Manhattan Jaguar Land Rover showroom did triple duty — introducing new versions of the Land Rover Range Rover Velar S.U.V. and the Jaguar XE sedan, promoting the new digs and giving V.I.P. customers the opportunity to meet insiders like the designer Ian Callum.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Maximum impact is critical for important vehicles. Toyota hired the installation artist Michael Murphy to construct
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://vimeo.com/329144569" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  a three-dimensional model
 </a>
 of the all-new Highlander S.U.V. using 200 panels of suspended paper. Perhaps you saw its image projected onto New York buildings and billboard spaces this week?
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The reveal of the actual vehicle, staged a stone’s throw from the Javits Convention Center, had the paper sculpture suspended near the D.J. Vashtie Kola’s performance set. That’s a lot of edgy art to market a three-row family crossover.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Some companies without space at the show use its glow for extra coverage. The $2.27 million all-electric Battista hypercar, the first production vehicle by the famed design house Pininfarina, made its United States debut in the Chelsea neighborhood. Its swoopy body and 1,900-horsepower drivetrain will not be shown on the Javits floor.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “Battista is a piece of automotive art,” said Dan Connell, brand manager of Automobili Pininfarina. “As such, we have selected a fantastic, exclusive gallery in Chelsea to present this design masterpiece.” Considering how many journalists covering the show descended on the studio, the strategy worked.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Preshow events let manufacturers spend focused time with journalists that isn’t possible on the show floor. At the Lincoln Corsair crossover introduction, writers rotated through three stations as designers and engineers showed how the car was developed.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 “There’s no better way to show what we’re doing and how we’re growing this brand than to bring writers in and give them an in-depth look at what we’re doing and why we’re doing it,” said Megan McKenzie, marketing manager for the Lincoln S.U.V.s.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Nissan used one of two events for nostalgia. The Datsun (as Nissan was once known in the United States) 240Z was unveiled at the Pierre Hotel in Manhattan five decades ago. So it was perhaps fitting that the reveal of the 50th anniversary edition Z car, now badged 370Z, was held Monday evening at the same site (though Z Car enthusiasts were probably hoping for a glimpse of a long overdue all-new model). A second Chelsea soiree was packed with past and present performance machines.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Sage Marie, public relations vice president with American Honda, sees the value of running events before the big show. “If our press reveal at Javits is late in the day, some media will be overwhelmed,” he said. “Tuesday’s preview of our limited-edition TLX,” which is hand-built in the center where the Acura NSX supercar is produced, “helps our chances at coverage.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Conversely, Mr. Marie said, sometimes a surprise provides the biggest punch. “We launched the all-new Civic concept in 2015,” he said. “No one expected it. And that bombshell stole the show.” Its chartreuse paint didn’t hurt.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In the shadow of the Vessel at Hudson Yards, Hyundai’s luxury brand, Genesis, wheeled out the Mint, an electric two-seat concept city car with a minimalist interior. It was one of the hottest tickets in town, with passers-by trying to sneak in. One woman offered a writer $100 for his admission lanyard.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Asked if the Mint would reach production, a Genesis official offered a hint: “We generally don’t produce concept cars willy-nilly.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Smaller events like these orbit all the major auto shows, often with lofty budgets.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Days before the 2018 Los Angeles Auto Show, Porsche turned its L.A. Experience center into a media extravaganza to introduce the brand’s spiritual touchstone: the all-new 911 for 2020. The actor Armie Hammer was there, bleacher seating for hundreds of journalists was erected, and acres of custom video displays caused a commercial producer next to me to ponder aloud, “How did they figure out how to shoot for a screen 40 yards long?”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 These expensive launches can actually be bargains for automakers. The cost of many events is less than running a television ad during an N.F.L. game.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Despite all of this, plenty of automakers will stick to the traditional reveal at the Javits Convention Center. Look for Hyundai’s new Venue crossover and Sonata sedan plus Subaru’s all-new Outback, among dozens of others.

 No matter the onscreen decade, Elisabeth Moss knows how to suffer in it.

 Moss has become a patron saint of the beaten down and abused.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Such bleakness has been consistent in her lesser-seen roles as well, most notably in the work of the New York writer and director Alex Ross Perry. He has cast Moss in three movies, including “Queen of Earth,” from 2015, filming her character’s gradual unraveling in punishing close-ups.

 With looping tracking shots that capture the sweaty backstage claustrophobia of a rock club, as well as the drain-swirl of addiction, the film was inspired by a diverse group of artists, including Guns N’ Roses, Jawbreaker, Nirvana, Bikini Kill and L7, Perry said. Moss’s list of references added Amy Winehouse, Marilyn Monroe and more. And then there’s Courtney Love, whose look, style and antics as the lead singer of Hole most closely mirror the chaos of Becky and her band, Something She.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Moss, who learned guitar and piano for the part, spoke by phone recently about missing out on punk, her penchant for dark roles and where Love fits into the “Her Smell” universe. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.

<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  What do you remember about riot grrrl and grunge as it was happening?
 </strong>
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 I was a ballet dancer since I was like 5 years old, and around that time I would’ve been 11 or 12. I was just not on that train. I remember hearing the most popular ones — Nirvana and stuff like that — on the radio. But it seemed like something for older people and definitely cooler people. And I don’t think I really understood it. I was a pretty happy kid. So when I approached this, I was really honest with Alex, like, “This is a whole world that I don’t necessarily understand.”
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  I know there was a syllabus, as well as an email chain of reference points. Was there anything in particular that grabbed you?
 </strong>
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 I think for me, watching a lot of old backstage, behind-the-scenes documentaries, just trying to get a feeling for that time. I was looking for something that I could emotionally connect to and feel that anger and that passion. [Agyness Deyn, who co-stars as Moss’s bandmate] was really instrumental in Gayle [Rankin, who rounds out the trio] and I’s journey into the music. She’s so in that scene and knowledgeable, and we were like, I don’t know, “Blink-182, is that a thing?” I would listen to L7 and Bikini Kill, but Elastica was the one that really bridged the divide for me between the most popular and the most authentic.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 One conversation that was really helpful was with Beck, who I got on the phone with for about three hours one day. He explained to me where that music came from and why they were so angry and dissatisfied and felt misunderstood.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  There’s been some pushback from you all on the Courtney Love connection, but there are a lot of references in the film that point back to her. Did you engage at all with her in your preparations?
 </strong>
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It’s almost impossible to avoid because she’s arguably the most famous female musician from that time, and is also, you know, blonde. So visually you’ve got the connection there. And obviously there are some stories that are well-documented that would make sense as far as Becky goes [
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  laughs
 </em>
 ]. But I said to Alex, “Do we want to make the Courtney Love story? Let’s go talk to her and we’ll make that movie.” But we didn’t want to make that.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 That’s the only reason we push back against it — it wasn’t our intention. She wasn’t not a part of it, of course. But I used Kurt Cobain as much as Courtney Love.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  Have you heard from Courtney?
 </strong>
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 No, I haven’t! But I’ve met her a couple of times and she’s always been super cool and nice to me.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  Your line delivery in “Her Smell” is this bizarre combination of punk patois, Shakespearean grandeur and manic rambling. Were there real-life reference points for how Becky should sound offstage?
 </strong>
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It was all there in the script — the pauses, the weird references. There’s not one word of ad-lib or improv. I did watch a lot of disturbing YouTube videos, like meth heads and things like that. Even sometimes just watching a documentary about Oasis and seeing some of the backstage conversation, that sunk into my head somewhere.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  Even with your character Kitty from “Us” or “Top of the Lake,” you’ve become a vehicle for pain and suffering. What keeps drawing you to these brutal roles?
 </strong>
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 I just find it more interesting and more challenging. I’m a pretty happy person myself. There’s just nothing super interesting or dramatic about watching somebody who’s doing well and doing her laundry, as I’m doing today.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But it has become a little bit of an inside joke among people that I collaborate with: How can they write something that I’m going to be like, “Oh, wow, that’s challenging,” or “Oh, god, that’s dark”? I said to the writers on “Handmaid’s” at the beginning of the season, “Your job is to write something that I’m going to read and be like, [

</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  You’ve maintained a career where you can balance some pretty niche art films with the most talked-about shows and blockbusters. Is it fun to have something like “Us” out in the world, where you’re so much a part of the zeitgeist?
 </strong>
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 It is super fun. That was a different experience for me because I’ve never been in a movie that people knew they were going to go see [
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  laughs
 </em>
 ]. I’ve never been in something that had an expectation of making money at the box office. That’s the truth. On Monday, people talked to me about it because everyone went to see it that weekend. I’m so grateful for Jordan for asking me to be a part of something historic.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
   (Spoilers for “Us” follow.)
  </strong>
 </em>
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  When you saw the movie in theaters, what was it like watching people react to your murder?
 </strong>
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 I loved it, I thought it was hilarious. When we shot it, Jordan called that scene a 7-second massacre. The crawling on the floor thing, we just knew when we did it that it was going to be cool.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  Something “Us” and “Her Smell” have in common is that you get to be funny, even if the other characters in the scenes with you are not amused. Do you feel comfortable in comedic roles?
 </strong>
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 I never get to do that! No one ever asks me to do that. I definitely have gotten — pigeonholed is a negative word so I don’t want to use it — but definitely gotten this reputation for doing more dramatic material. So it was so fun to do something different. And to play that girl [in “Us”], too — I would like to do a whole movie where I play that girl. I’ve had so many women come up to me and be like, “Oh my god, you got the basic blonde so good.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  Do you think we’re living in a golden age of complicated female characters, or is it just your career?
 </strong>
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 For sure, I think we are. It’s fantastic. It’s become completely different for me than it was 15 years ago. You have all of these movies that are being headlined by women and some of them, thankfully, made by women. I think people woke up to the fact that there were all these stories that hadn’t been told that were interesting and incredibly entertaining and artistic and also could make a [
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">

 ] of money. The industry woke up to that and the actresses, who were always there and always ready, stepped forward and showed everyone how it’s done.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">
  We’re in a bit of a moment for music films, too. What would you say to a fan of “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “A Star Is Born” — should they see “Her Smell”?
 </strong>
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 I mean … [
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">

 ] I would say it’s a very different film. In tone, in structure, in character. Very, very different. “Her Smell” can be a tough movie to watch. It’s not as perhaps as easy to swallow. If you want to see the

</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">

 Today, we think of Marvel as the monolithic studio that each year reliably releases two or three blockbusters based on its costume-clad comic-book superheroes. It has built movies like

 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/02/movies/02iron.html?module=inline" title="">
  “Iron Man”
 </a>
 in 2008.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 But Marvel’s prosperous future was hardly a certainty a decade or so ago. In the mid-2000s it was a smaller, inexperienced company that controlled the film rights for only a few of its lesser-known characters — other studios had already brought “X-Men,” “Spider-Man” and “Fantastic Four” to theaters — at a time when no one in Hollywood was yet contemplating the idea of an interconnected universe of superhero movies.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 That changed with the help of people like Kevin Feige, who had been an associate producer on “X-Men” before Marvel hired him in 2000; and
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/movies/20carr.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Movies&amp;module=inline&amp;region=EndOfArticle&amp;pgtype=article" title="">
  Robert Downey Jr.
 </a>
 , the veteran actor who was almost no one’s idea of a mass-market magnet when he emerged as a candidate to play Tony Stark, the eccentric billionaire hero of “Iron Man.”
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In interviews, Feige, now the president of Marvel Studios, and Downey — a star of three “Iron Man”s, four “Avengers” and a “Spider-Man” — spoke about the origins of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the choices they made, and what it’s all meant as “Endgame” approaches. Here are edited excerpts from those conversations.

 In 2006, when we were making our first appearance as our own studio at Comic-Con, the articles written around that were basically: “Marvel’s going to try to make movies themselves now. Too bad they’ve got to scrape the bottom of the barrel.” And I remember feeling, wow, I don’t think it’s the bottom of the barrel.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Initially, there were 10 characters on an official list. And Iron Man was not one of them. Iron Man became one of them when the rights reverted back to Marvel from [New Line Cinema], it instantly went to the top of the list. We were very excited that we could do something different with that film. We had that and

  “The Incredible Hulk”
 </a>
 in the same year. And internally, at Marvel corporate, “Hulk” — by far, the better-known property — seemed like the slam-dunk and “Iron Man” seemed like the risk.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">
  Marvel started hiring cast and crew for “Iron Man” in 2006 — first, the director Jon Favreau and then its star, Robert Downey Jr., both of whom were coming off recent flops.

 Jon and I had this connection. He’d had a movie that I very much enjoyed, and I’d had one that he very much enjoyed, bomb at the same time. His was

 I have a distinct memory of being in this bullpen area of our production office, kicking around ideas with Jon, and Robert’s name came up. We both stopped and looked at each other, like: “Oh, that would be awesome. But nah, you can’t do that. Anyway, who else?” And we kept coming back to that.

 I took a meeting at Marvel. And then I was very pushy, to be honest, which is not really in my nature. But I just had a sneaking suspicion that I had nothing to lose. I decided to take it more seriously than I’d ever taken anything. I felt confident, and then I was told that the meeting went well but I wouldn’t put too much on it, it’s probably not going to go your way. I refused to let go of it.

 I remember saying to a room full of marketing executives: “If we do our job right, the name Tony Stark will be as famous as the name Iron Man. Because unlike a lot of hero movies, this character is as interesting and as engaging outside of his costume, as he is inside of his costume.” [Downey had] not done something like this before, which meant, I felt, a screen test would help convince anybody that needed to be convinced. He, to his credit, was absolutely willing to audition for it.

 We were at an assembly hangar where they made the Spruce Goose.

We’re gonna do the plan! This is going to be a big deal. And the press did not treat it like a big deal. It was a footnote to an article about the success of the “Iron Man” opening weekend. And I went, Oh, I guess people don’t get it yet. [Laughs]

 The real daunting thing was, oh, that’s right, we have to go do this again. We get a year break, and I stayed very busy that year, and then we had to do it again. The word “franchise” is a verb, if you ask me. You are iterating something that needs to be recreated in some way and expanded upon every time.

 I started to use phrases like “Phase 1 of the MCU,” because I didn’t want to merely think of an “Iron Man” trilogy or a “Thor” trilogy. Which is really the way most people had been conditioned to think about franchises. It all came from the comics — individual characters would occasionally come together for a mega-event limited series, in which everything would change, and then they would go back into their own comics, with the new powers or the new costumes or the psychological changes from that big adventure. That’s what we could do with one phase, and then an “Avengers” movie, a second phase, another “Avengers” movie, and then a third one to close it out.

 The first “Avengers” tour was just mind-bogglingly cool and strange, considering that the film was about to be released but was already being treated like it was a phenomenon. The sheer fact that the world was going, oh, you actually got a lot of actors and actresses to get along for long enough.

  As this latest phase of Marvel movies nears its conclusion, Feige and Downey tried to summarize the experience.

 This has been my life for the better part of a decade. I’ve gotten married in that decade. I’ve had two kids in that decade. And I’ve produced 23 movies in that decade. I almost don’t want to stop and think about it, for fear of getting blubbery and embarrassing myself.

 If someone had walked into Giorgio Baldi that night and said, hey guys, I’m 10 Years From The Future Guy, let me tell what you started here. You would just go, “No, what if this goes wrong?” You’d be tripping on the what-if’s. It’s a faith-based activity.

 In Issue No. 5 of the Unstoppable Wasp, which arrives in comic stores on Wednesday, the title hero comes to a realization: “I need help. I think I’m bipolar … and I don’t think I can handle this alone.”

 Last month, the teenage Wasp was shown intensely trying to solve one problem, which then multiplied into a huge problem. The chalkboard she used for her plans is a cacophony of ideas. The situation seems familiar to Nadia’s mentor, Janet Van Dyne (the original Wasp and the ex-wife of Hank Pym). “This looks a lot like a manic episode,” she says, while telling Nadia’s friends that Hank had bipolar disorder. “If it’s not treated, a person can have episodes — intense changes in mood — especially in times of stress,” she explains.
</p><p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Nadia’s having bipolar disorder is something Whitley discussed with his editor,
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/AlannaWrites" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Alanna Smith
 </a>
 , early on. In doing his research, Whitley said in a telephone interview, he learned that bipolar disorder can be passed along genetically. “I thought it made sense that she would most likely deal with it at some point,” he added.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 In the January issue, Nadia was shown running on fumes, refusing to sleep or eat until her work was done. She also lashed out against her friends.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 The confrontation continues in the new issue as Nadia retreats into her miniature laboratory. In that subatomic environment, where time moves more quickly, Nadia goes into a depressive phase. One of her friends follows her, and the two have a powerful moment (better experienced than spoiled here).
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Whitley said he heard from family members of people with bipolar disorder who recognized the manic behavior in the previous issue. They “could see what was happening before anyone said anything,” he said.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 His goal, he said, was to make sure the condition was treated respectfully, and he consulted with psychologists on the subject. He said he “also wanted to reflect the reality of the situation: Bipolar disorder is not something you can cure,” though medicine and therapy can help. He hopes that coping with the disorder remains an important part of the Wasp’s character, but not her entire being: “For real people, there’s so much more to their lives and personalities than this one thing.”

 In Issue No. 5, the regular Q. and A. feature is with
 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/cceary1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">
  Chris Ceary
 </a>
 , who teaches psychology at Johns Hopkins University’s Peabody Institute. Ceary discusses comics, mental health and the presentation of Nadia’s bipolar disorder. “I know so many people will feel seen by this depiction, and that is a gift,” she says.
</p>
<p class="css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0">
 Whitley was also proud that it is one of Nadia’s friends who helps her. “It was important to me to have this character who is not a superhero, who does not have any sort of exceptional powers, to save the day because she has the life experience to help Nadia,” he said. “There are a lot of stories out there of people who have made it through things because they had the right person at the right time.”

 An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified the artist of the cover of Issue No. 5 of the Unstoppable Wasp. It is Stacey Lee, not Gurihuru.
